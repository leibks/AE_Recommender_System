Lasted the whole day on my normal to dry skin. I did set it with powder. The reason for 3 stars is because the color selection can be tricky. I purchased yellow beige which was described as for light skin with yellow undertones, in my opinion this would be for medium skin.

It comes with a spatula, but instead I moistened my fingertips and applied it as I would my normal foundation. I was quite surprised and impressed by the coverage as I blended it. Since it comes hardened in the jar it was not as easy to apply as a liquid is, but warming it with the fingers seemed to help the spread. I dotted it and blended on my brown spots and it didn't seem to cake but looked fairly natural. I was very pleased with the outcome.

So why only 4 stars -- well, the truth is that the hard product in the jar isn't that easy to use. I didn't use the ""scoop"" and just twirled my fingers in the jar. It would be easy to overdo this. It is essential to get the right color for your skin and there is a handy chart on the website to use. I was thinking that a sponge might help with application, but I find that those just waste a lot of product. I also use a powder to set it. It is definitely thicker than my usual make-up and it's important to apply thinkly to avoid the ""caked-on"" look.

I really want my powder to be able to perform for regular wear too.  I like a thin layer brushed on top to finish the look.

My hair dried pretty quickly, but what really surprised me was how much smoother my hair looked and felt with this dryer versus my cheapie ceramic drier.

One thing that I noted was that there are artificial colors in this mask when it is pretty much just white anyway.  It seems like those are just unnecessary to me.  There's also some fragrance components that could cause some people problems, though the scent itself is just very light and not at all strong.  The clay is Kaolin.

It comes out as a thick white lotion that I spread over my face.  I received a tester and there were no instructions.  I used it like I would any other mask, applying it to my face and letting it dry before rinsing it well.

I picked this out to try because my skin is normally dry, but during big temperature changes like we have in the South during the spring, it gets very, very oily, and that's been a problem lately.  This has some menthol it in that felt slightly cooling on my skin.  I read while it dried and found it pleasant to have on.  It rinsed off easily.  I felt like it took every bit of oil, dirt, sweat- everything, out of my skin.  My skin felt vacuumed out.  My skin looked a bit rosy and felt a bit dry and tight.  I put some moisturizer on and my skin just sucked it up, much more than normal.  24 hours later and my skin still didn't feel oily, only normal.

I would say that this is going to be a product that people should figure out for themselves how often to use.  I would reserve use of it for myself for times during seasonal changes when my skin gets very oily.  I would avoid this normally when my skin was dry, because this mask is very drying to me.  I do really appreciate that it is good at decreasing oiliness and cleansing and tightening pores.

I would recommend this for people with oily skin.  It does have some ingredients that could be a problem or very sensitive skin though, and it could cause a bit of breakout at first- it has willow bark in it and ingredients that often will 'uncover' breakouts about to happen anyway, though they should be less serious than usual and descrease quickly.

Before even using it, I checked out the list of ingredients and that raised a question mark in my mind why would this product cost so much when it has 2 types of parabens in it.  Here is the list of ingredients: Water (Aqua), Pentaerythrityl Tetracaprylate/Tetracaprate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propylene Glycol, C12-20 Acid PEG-8 Ester, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Glycerin, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Glyceryl Stearate, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract, Dimethicone, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Linoleate, Leontopodium Alpinum Extract, Artemia Extract, Ursolic Acid, Salicyloyl Phytosphingosine, Sodium Carboxymethyl Beta-Glucan, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Allantoin, Cetyl Phosphate, Carbomer, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Ceratonia Siliqua Gum, Glyceryl Linolenate, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Oleanolic Acid, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Polyacrylamide, Laureth-7, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Fragrance (Parfum), Linalool, Limonene, Coumarin, Geraniol, alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.

As one can see there are so many artificial ingredients in this product, that can make one dizzy.  As excited as I was that this product contains amaranth, artemis flower, rosemary, pea, sage, mango and shea butter it also contains methylparaben and ethylparaben.  For anyone allergic to the fragrance, a note that this product dies contain fragrance.  Product provides a lot of moisture on the skin and it absorbs well without leaving residue.  It is perfect for using underneath the make up.  But the other weakness of this product is that it does not have SPF so one should apply SPF on top of this crme.

After trying for a week, I didn't notice much difference.  Just a few notes about some ingredients, many of which can be found in most face moisturizers.

Moisturizes / hydrates / protects due to the Glyceryl Linolenate, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Glycerin, Shea butter, and Mango butter)

Goes on smooth and skin conditioning and (Pentaerythrityl Tetracaprylate/Tetracaprate, Oleanolic Acid, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, sage and rosemary leaf extracts)

Slightly fragrant (mainly due to Fragrance Parfum, Linalool, Limonene, Coumarin, and Geraniol)

Use of Artemia Extract (zooplankton-extracted from brine shrimp), is becoming popular for anti-aging creams. First, its animal based. Second, used to protect skin from extreme thermal stress like cold temperatures or UV Rays. Third, there is really little to no information on it other than it appears to be in a few luxury products.

Most of the other ingredients include emulsifiers, preservatives, chelating agents, antioxidants, anti-aging, etc.

Now, about the use of parabens, I would expect given the trend of moving away from these types of preservatives that a product of this price and quality would approach a more main stream stance of replacing them.

Just a bit odd for me that the ingredients on the box don't match what is on the website. For example, the box states it contains Methylparaben, butylparaben and proxypaparben while the website states Methylparaben and Ethylparaben.

Over, its a very nice moisturizer and hydrating facial cream, but at the price point of $365 for 1.7oz, it is very over priced compared to other facial creams and ingredients in the luxury category.

It's safe to say that I would not buy this again, unless the price is lowered significantly.

Another problem I have with the product is the scent. Gosh, it's awful. I cringe when I apply it to my skin. Still, the scent fades pretty quickly which is good. If I continued to smell it throughout the day, I would definitely stop using the product.

The best, most effective applications are taking it: after shower/bath, on daily basis before sleeping, for deep moisturizing especially in dry environments (dry climate, winter, or air-conditioned/heated rooms/spaces/quarters), and against dry skin in general. After the use, the dry skin hydration increases resulting in a visible improvement in the skin smoothness and softness. Nevertheless, the wrinkles somewhat lost their depth and pronunciation without any doubts. However, the lotion made the skin more delicate that might have been an unavoidable byproduct of its increased softness. For the same reason, the skin became min. more sensitive to touch and prone to scratch, but - at the same time - faster healing for its increased moist, as under a Band-Aid. It is mid-priced.

Ingredients are plant based, and the main ingredient is coco-caprylate, a skin conditioning agent derived from coconut oil.  Its one reason why this oil provides such good hydration, spreadability and such a silky feel.  The extensive addition of other oils and seaweeds helps reduce wrinkles and fine lines.

It really gets absorbed and seems to lock in moisture. When I get up in morning my face looks smoother and more refreshed.  I also like that it isn't sticky or thick and seems to work with my skin unlike other oils which seem to clog my pores.  The marine oil has a faint herbal scent that is sort of more masculine opposed to a citrus or flowery scent which is not off putting and which I like.  I did try using it in the morning and let is soak in my face before using my BB Cream.  But this was a bad combination.  The oil actually separated the BB Cream and probably would do the same with any foundation or concealer you might use.  I think this is because although it is light there is still a oil barrier on the surface or you face that the make up does not mix well with.  So perhaps this oil does not completely absorb but locks in moisture, preventing it from leaving.  It might be a good idea to use my facial regime/ treatment such as cleaning, moisturizing and any serums first then at this oil last to lock everything in.",1520208000,,"ELEMIS Pro-Collagen Eye Renewal Cream, Anti-wrinkle Eye, 0.5 fl. oz.",Luxury Beauty,$74.00,2018/03/05,0.002638858686958538

I never tried this brand before and wanted to have at least a vague opinion on their products before buying the full size.

The `Hydrate` shampoo and conditioner left my hair thin frizzy hair very smooth and hydrating, but I didn't noticed any major difference from the `Sheer Hydrate` (including the awful smell I absolutely dislike of ylang-ylang and pathouli). For being hydrating, it doesn't make my hair oily too much faster than usual, maybe I get half a day less of `non-oiliness`.

The shampoo did a nice thick lather and cleaned my hair without leaving it squeaky clean (I would need to use it in conjunction with a deep cleaning shampoo once 2-3 washes). I have sensitive scalp with a tendency to get dandruff, with this I didn't get a itchy scalp.
The conditioner wasn't very thick, I was afraid it wouldn't do anything for my hair. But the next day the hair was soft, supple and shinny/luminous (I just loved how healthy it looked); still, it was flat, limp, without any volume.

They were OK shampoo and conditioner, but I will not purchase a full size because I hate the smell of this line. It had a strong herby-minty scent that lingered in my hair until the next wash (although it wasn't that strong)... I'm not a fan of ylang-ylang and the combination with bergamot and patchouli is just awful. Still, for people that enjoy this scent it can be a reason to buy this.",1521763200,,Pureology Hydrate Shampoo,Luxury Beauty,$54.40,2018/03/23,0.027157255734905853

Thermal water works wonders to balance the Ph of the skin, especially for sensitive skin. It can also be used to refresh the skin throughout the day. Some even use it to set their makeup because of the fine, even mist.
I keep mine in the refrigerator and use it first thing in the morning after washing my face. My son has very dry skin, he suffers from eczema, and loves to use it every few hours to add a bit of moisture and refresh the skin.
Ive tried several types of thermal water- Vichy, La Roche Posay, Avene- and the Evian is hands down my favorite; Ive been using it for about 8 years now. Its mostly due to the fact that Evians spray nozzle sprays evenly and is the most consistent, bottle after bottle.
The results from the other brands are practically identical, at least when it comes to its effect on the skin, but Evian is just more dependable. Theres no leaking from the nozzle, no uneven spraying, no clogs, and all the water gets used up.

I was at first surprised at how small this bottle was.  I've used other eye repair complexes though and most have a similar amount of content.

Nia24 follows a recent trend of using niacin in a molecular formula to stimulate DNA repair.  It has a Peptide blend to reinforce collagen, Vitamin C, Licorice and White Birch to brighten as well as Caffeine to reduce puffiness.

Together, these powerful ingredients target the signs of aging around the orbital bone.

Does it work?  I have used various products with great success, including Lancome, L'Occitane, Tatcha, Strivectin.  I believe this formula is on par with those products although each has its own ""personality"".  I did notice brightening and the general reduction in fine lines as well as a big reduction in dark circles.

I consider a product of this calibre an indulgence but also necessary as the aging process takes it toll.  I would recommend this product as equivalent to many of the other luxury eye repair brands.",1522540800,,"Nia 24 Eye Repair Complex, 0.5 fl. oz.",Luxury Beauty,$53.25,2018/04/01,-0.02233742341975267

Pro-niacin: improves skin tone, texture & hyperpigmentation
Peptide blend: reinforces collagen & elastin to visibly reduce fine lines and wrinkles
Vitamin C, licorice, white birch: brightens to illuminate under eye discoloration
Caffeine: reduces appearance of puffiness

Does it do all that? Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say it does, at least not for the first three times I've used it. The eye cream doesn't say it works better over time, just that it helps each time you use it. Frankly, I just like that it's a good eye cream that'll keep the skin around my eyes from feeling dry and doesn't irritate my eyes.

It also seems to have improved the wrinkles on the back of my hands.  It's funny how you first notice getting old, I was only in my late teens or maybe it was early 20's when I noticed the tips of my fingers started to have some lines in them.  It really disturbed me at the time seeing even moderate aging.  I can relate to how some women and men take drastic steps to retain their youth.  As a man, I'm not to vain about most things, graying hair, glasses, not able to do the physical things I could 30 years ago.  Having something that helps your skin and save it from premature aging is a good thing.  I've seen pictures of and in person those sun worshiper types, that look haggard and saggy from sun damage and dry skin.  Some even in their 30's look downright awful.

This works with a combination of nutrition, vitamins, oils and other things to strengthen the skin and keep it moist.  I can't complain about any of the contents and they appear to have done a good job blending them together in one effective compound.  It is expensive, a small tube costs a lot of money, but many of the things that work are.

It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass.

Thermal water works wonders to balance the Ph of the skin, especially for sensitive skin. It can also be used to refresh the skin throughout the day. Some even use it to set their makeup because of the fine, even mist.
I keep mine in the refrigerator and use it first thing in the morning after washing my face. My son has very dry skin, he suffers from eczema, and loves to use it every few hours to add a bit of moisture and refresh the skin.
Ive tried several types of thermal water- Vichy, La Roche Posay, Avene- and the Evian is hands down my favorite; Ive been using it for about 8 years now. Its mostly due to the fact that Evians spray nozzle sprays evenly and is the most consistent, bottle after bottle.
The results from the other brands are practically identical, at least when it comes to its effect on the skin, but Evian is just more dependable. Theres no leaking from the nozzle, no uneven spraying, no clogs, and all the water gets used up.

I was excited to try out the TNS serum which uses growth factors to make skin look better. Growth factors have been in the skincare news for awhile based on their potential. They can, supposedly, rejuvenate collagen and elastin (two important things for the skin) at the cellular level.

However, the research isn't conclusive, with some arguing that the growth factors cant even get into the skin to be effective. Theres also been some concern about them creating favorable conditions for skin cancer.

However, most ingredients in skincare have a hard time getting deep into the skin. A good solution to overcome this is micro-needling. If you don't do this already, youll see a huge benefit if you add the practice. Its easy and cheap. Just Google it (or derma rolling).

As for the cancer claims, theres never been any hard evidence or conclusive proof. And, given the overall risk factors many people have for the disease, it would be hard to isolate one factor like this.

After using this cream for several weeks with micro-needling, I definitely notice that my skin looks better. However, I use other items (internally and externally), so its difficult to say this made a huge difference. But, it definitely helped.

Given the high price, Id research it to make sure its right for you. A lot of people swear by it and, if you have the money, its a good bet to make your skin look more youthful.

First thing I noticed was how cheap the packaging is. Normally that doesn't bother me too much since I'd rather be paying for what's in the bottle than what's outside of it but this packaging is a problem. It's supposed to dispense a red liquid and a white liquid in equal amounts when you press down on the pump however after only a couple weeks it only dispenses the red liquid now. I have to try to cover the red hole and push it down again to get any of the white liquid to come out which makes a big mess and usually just gives me twice as much red as white. It's really annoying. I've cleaned out the tube and everything thinking that maybe it was blocked but it's not. I don't know if the pump dispenser inside the white side came loose but it's not like I've been rough on this bottle or anything. It goes in my drawer and out of my drawer and that's it. As for what it's done for my skin, I'm not really sure I see a huge difference. It's nice and I do like the way it feels on my skin but I can't really see any huge benefits, certainly not any that justify the cost and the crummy packaging.

I've been using Clarins Double Serum for last couple years; Sisley, Guerlain and Channel serums prior (I use after cleansing, after moisturizing day cream).  This seems a little pricey - but probably because i'd never heard of this brand before.  Cost wise, it's about in the middle.

So far the only negative (thus 4 stars) is that the pump does not distribute both contents equally at each ""pump"".  There is a light yellowish cream and a redish color more opaque that come out separately.  pump in your hand, then I rub together and then smooth over face.

In this case, I didn't have to. Why? Because I used to use this a few years ago and its great. I used to visit a top doctor in Beverly Hills and I had gotten facials and fillers and some beauty products to try. Well, I didn't care much for the fillers, but I did love the products, the main one being this - the SkinMedica TNS Essential Serum.

This doctor told me that all the top doctors and aestheticians recommend this product and its the one that he and his staff all use. I don't want to use his name here but youve probably heard of him and he does have an excellent reputation; he never gave me bad advice.

So why did I stop? Only because it became too expensive. No stars off for that, because I think a product should be reviewed on how well it works. And it does work.

I do have a recommendation about this -  before you first use the product, tap it solidly on its base on the counter a few times - you want the two serums  to come out evenly and at the same time when you use the pump.

So I do recommend this. It is expensive and you are somewhat restricted in how much you use, since it dispenses the same amount with every pump; so you cant stretch this out to make it last longer.

My skin really loves this lotion, it sinks in a bit deeper and leaves less residue than other body lotions I've used. I also love that it's fragrance free, I work outdoors and sometimes fragrance can attract insects, which is a real pain! Nothing like being attacked by no seeums because you happen to smell like a big flower, boy they love perfume. My skin needs a better quality lotion than I can find OTC, and this one competes well with those I've purchased from spas. In fact, I believe Bioderma is a product that's carried in spas, but I'm not entirely sure.

I like to give a good exfoliation to my skin before using ANY product because it just wouldn't be fair to review it any other way with a thick layer of dead skin preventing decent absorption. I also like to shave my legs, etc. because my skin tends to resist any appliaction of lotion if I have 'stubble'. Doing both of these preps makes a big difference, and I noticed that my freshly scrubbed and shaven skin doesn't sting after applying this lotion, so it's gentle. That's an important point since my skin can stay irritated for hours and days once it gets started down that path. I also don't notice any ingrown hair(s) which can happen to me quite readily the day after shaving if a product clogs my pores. So far that hasn't happened so I'm very pleased.

The spots where I have eczema (right now an elbow and knee) do seem softer and less red and irritated. This is a more occlusive lotion that keeps water from evaporating from the surface of the skin and doesn't depend on a lot of oils to moisturize. However, it does contain mineral oil so people with acne on the body might have an issue with this ingredient. I'd do a patch test if this is the case just to be on the safe side.

My husband's skin is like leather though- when he put some on, it began to look more like oil than lotion for a minute as his skin resisted absorbing it initially, which was quite different from my experience.  He had to work a bit harder to get it applied, but with a bit of massage, his skin began to absorb it and he commented on how good it felt.  Normally he doesn't like lotion, or sunscreen, but he's always working outside- hence the leathery skin.  He really liked that it wasn't scented, and that it felt soothing to him.

Obviously the thing that jumps out about the Sultra is the high price (currently $130 but I've seen <$100).  It's true you can get curling irons for ~$20 but like cars you can get a $20k car or a $100k one...they both roll though one may get you there faster and in more style.  Once you add features the price can climb...and in this case the Bombshell is ceramic and has infrared heating which are two pricey options above the base model.

Infrared heating has become popular in curling irons (or rods) because it heats fast and within which means deeper heating for your hair (faster and longer results).  In terms of use my daughter watched a youtube video about how to use this and she was on her way.  First off so you don't forget this is not a toy it comes with a heating glove and heat resistant pad to rest the rod down.  The glove is great since no more burns (really you could buy a glove to use with any heating iron).  My daughter simply wraps her hair around the rod and instant loose curls and she is very happy with the results.  Also note this curling iron does not have a clamp which helps reduce crimping and frizzing.  Note that I believe Bomba also sells 1.5"" version for bigger curls.

Build quality is nice and has held up well so far (I will update my review if any issues).  Overall, a nice high end curling iron that produces high end results and faster than usual.  You pay more but if the results work for you then compare that to the cost of just a few salon visits.  Also note that although pricey this Bombshell did make some recent best of lists such as Allure.  There are some other curling irons out there with ceramic and infrared that can be purchased for less but I can't speak for their results.

I  have very thick, coarse hair that is hard to curl and my curls held it all day with no hairspray.  I was expecting to have to flat iron it after my first attempt but to my surprise it looked good and with just a little more practice would look even better.  I expected the rod curling iron to be tapered like most others I have seen, but it is all the same width, so it looks just like a traditional curling iron but without the clip.

The only reason I took off one star is because I do not see the benefits of using a rod curling iron over the old fashioned type of curling iron that clips the end of your hair.  The two minor issues I had would have been solved with a regular curling iron--it was hard to get the curl all the way down to the ends of my hair, and my arms got tired having to do my whole head.

Its been hard to deal with for as long as I can remember, and even though Ive been living with it my entire life, I never quite became good with hair, the way some people do.  On its own its neither perfectly straight nor wavy; it tends to frizz and it attracts static like nobodys business. For the longest time, I wore my hair in the same layered style, turning the ends under and trying to feather the front.  Or trying to wear a side part that didn't end up looking greasy by the end of the day.  Forget flatirons  they make my hair look limp and in need of a good wash. And in spite of practicing at it every day for a solid year, watching every tutorial out there, and getting an in-person demo from my stylist, I never learned to make spiral curls with one.

The advent of the curling wand was a game changer for me.  I don't have to worry about my wrist not wanting to move a certain way, and I didn't have to learn any special techniques.  Its just wrap, count, and release. I can vary the waves by changing the size of the section of hair, and I can loosen them just a touch with a slight tug while they're still warm.  The versatility of these appliances is amazing.  I love that they come in so many sizes and shapes a allow for so many looks.

The Sultra BombShell is my fourth curling wand.  The 1  inch straight barrel allows me to do a big, subtle wave thats smooth and sleek.  I love the Morticia Addams look I can create with this  the waves are so loose, my hair looks like it just has an easy, natural wave.  My hair is extremely long, so a barrel this size works fairly well.  Im not sure how it would do on shorter hair.

The wand only has one heat setting, but it heats quickly.  I have another high end wand that gets much, much hotter (which is kind of scary actually) so if you have very thick or very coarse hair, you might want to experiment a bit to get your section size and time right.

I would definitely recommend this wand for anyone who has really long, fine hair like mine.  At the Amazon price of $130.00, its actually more expensive than the NuMe wand I have, but if it lasts as long as that one has (Ive had it four years) it would be worth it.

I do have to note that I don't use the heat gloves.  I discovered very early on that they get in my way and cause my very fine hair to frizz.  I am extremely careful when handing these hot wands however, and I don't recommend that anyone go without the glove who hasn't before, unless you are using a wand that has a cool tip (most higher end wands do not have one, but both of my Remington wands have this feature).  It takes a lot of practice to handle these things safely so its better to practice with a glove or a cool tip beforehand.",1518912000,,Sultra The Bombshell Rod Curling Iron,Luxury Beauty,$130.00,2018/02/18,-0.005841389481593838

What I don't like? I do wish it had a lower setting, even just a 'low/high' setting. I know it's supposed to be an optimal setting and it's a little lower than some of the ones on other curling irons and high settings on flat irons, but a little choice would be nice.

That said, it did produce some very nice curls without too much effort, following the instructions (wrap, hold for a few seconds, release, hold again, move on to another section).

I used this for about 3 weeks every day before coming down with the flu so I stopped for about 4 weeks (I was so sick!). Once I started feeling better I resumed, but did not use it every night.

Bottom line, this product seemed to work a little bit, but for the price it really fell short of my expectations. I have tried off-brand lash enhancers before and they were awful - made my eyes burn etc.. I can say this is the one product that did not burn my eyes at all.

When I looked at the photos other ladies posted I was excited by their results. The outcome for me was woefully less than other's photos showed. My expectation was my lashes would be visibly thicker and longer so I would not have to wear mascara. My result was no visible thickness or length without the use of makeup. When I put mascara on my eyelashes did stand out more than before - that is the only reason I gave it 3 stars.

Application of the product leads to no visible immediate change. This isn't mascara. It's simply a clear liquid that you apply to the base of your eyelashes after washing.

I was told it takes at least 3 to 4 weeks to notice any difference at all, but it can take longer for many people. Be patient!

My vision is very poor, even with my glasses on, so it was initially difficult to apply the conditioner safely to the lashes without swiping it on my skin or in my eyes. I bought a 7X magnifying mirror and I'm using a full spectrum light. Now I don't make mistakes on the conditioner, or my makeup!

I also found it easier to apply if I leave the RevitaLash container sitting in the base of the box it came in. The product has a very nice presentation box that allows the product to stand up in a foam stand, while the top lifts off. I just leave the RevitaLash in it at all times so all I have to do is unscrew the cap with the brush and leave the rest standing upright on my counter. It doesn't fall over, nothing spills, and it's easy to swipe the excess serum off the brush without losing any of it.

My primary focus has been my lower lashes, so that's the only place I have applied the product. I didn't see any results after 3-4 weeks, but I kept applying it. It's been 6 weeks now and my lashes are much improved! They are longer and there seems to be more of them, I guess it has helped prevent some of them from falling out. They are visible now, where they were barely there before.

I started off shaving with just plain bar soap and moved on to canned Barbasol cream, which I've used for probably the last 20 years. My skin is dry and somewhat prone to irritation/razor burn, although not truly sensitive. Lately I have also been experiencing some irritation and itching on my lower legs, which I attributed to winter dryness. A friend recently mentioned that his wife shaves with his Proraso soap, so I decided to give it a try. My husband gave me a quick tutorial on lathering, gave me a shave brush & lather bowl, and I gave it a shot. I'm very impressed with this soap. It lathers up quickly and easily, and has a creamy, rich consistency. I didn't find it overly mentholated or irritating - in fact, I barely noticed the menthol at all. I had concerns that it would over-dry my skin, and while it was definitely not hydrating, it also didn't dry me out. No nicks or cuts, no irritation. The first time out, I got one of the closest shaves I've ever had, and that was with a several days old cheap disposable razor. The next morning my legs were still smooth & stubble-free, which is unheard of for me. And that lower leg irritation I previously mentioned? Completely gone since switching to this soap. I have tried using this soap both with a secondary lather bowl, and with lathering directly on the skin with a brush. I personally think the bowl method works better, especially for legs, as it produces a thicker, more creamy lather. And as someone who is usually in a rush in the mornings, I should note that using this soap & a brush doesn't take me any longer than using my old canned shave cream. The frugal side of me appreciates that this one bowl of soap will probably last me 2-3 months of daily shaving, as I only need a small amount each day. There's also less packaging & waste compared to my old canned cream.

My hair:
My hair is naturally wavy  but will either look flyaway, frizz, puff, or get curly depending on the weather.

The unit:
The product has one power switch that slides either on or off. It does not accidentally turn off during use.
There is no temperature control.
The cord is super-long allowing a better range of motion OR a second person to assist with styling.

The glove:
There is a glove to use. This is not meant to directly touch the wand with as it isn't 100% heat proof...more like 75%. It serves t prevent accidental burns when holding the air in place.
The glove is HUGE.  I find this an issue as I have small hands and it makes it difficult to comb through a section of hair before wrapping it.

Use:
The directions indicate to wrap the hair around the wand, hold it for 15 seconds and then unwrap and hold until the curl is cool.
I personally do not have enough time to do this so I do let the hair hang to cool. I have not experienced any problems with this.

Results:
I've used this to make various types of curls and waves. Larger sections will make it wavier. Obviously smaller sections will create shorter springy curls.  I've had excellent results with all types of looks that I have attempted.  I never wrap the ends of my hair.  The results have lasted two days.  They would probably last longer but I prefer not to wash my hair less often than every other day.

Cons:
The glove, while necessary, is awkward to use because it doesn't fit right.
I am suspicious of any product that does not trust my ability to judge what temperature is best for my hair. It is my hair, after all. I have had it my entire life so I'm pretty sure I can make an informed decision about settings.
The reasons above are why I gave the product 4-stars versus 5.

The Iron is light weight, the swivel cord is long and doen't easily kink or get twisted.  The rod itself heats fast and has some little nubs to help guide the wrap.  I don't like the on/off switch becaause I found it too easy to accidentally flip the switch to ""off"" when I'm using it.

As far as ease of use, well your results will vary wildly depending on your hair type and cut.  I think this would work best on shoulder length hair that is blunt cut with a natural wave.  Unfortunately, I have baby-fine, chin length straight hair that has long layers.  If I wrestle in frustration for about 20 minutes, I can manage to get a ""beachy wave"" into my hair but that's about it.  No matter how small a section I take or how I draw the partition,  it has a range of different length hair within the section.  Per the directions, I wrap towards the skinny end of the iron and by the time I'm supposed to hold the tail end of the section while the curl sets, because of the multiple lenghts there is hardly any hair left to hold by the time I get to the end and the whole thing slides out and I have to start over.  It takes me about 3 attempts for each section and I always wind up with the last inch and a half being an angular straight peice rather than a continuation of the curl.  I may use this for special occasions but no way I'm going to put myself through this every morning.

Bottome line, if you know a curling rod works on your hair, this one would probably be fine for you.

I have very thick, long hair and this rod isn't really designed for my hair. I can only do thin sections at a time - about half the hair I can do with my traditional curling iron. It took twenty minutes to get noticable curls in half my hair. I just don't have that sort of time to waste. I would much rather be out having fun than spending forty minutes doing my hair.

My hair is shoulder length and not completely straight but I used this iron to put curls in my hair the way I wanted them. I do not care for perms because of the chemicals so I decided to try this iron out and after following the instructional video and papers I was able to get a really nice style with tight even curls that made it look like I had just had a perm. The iron is a bit more expensive than a regular curling iron but worth the price when you think about how much it would cost going to the salon to have it done all the time. It pays for itself in very little time. Again this is quality iron that does not damage your hair and you do not need to put a product on before you curl your hair. The video shows using a hair product but I found the product was not all that necessary. I can even say that my hair looks and feels better. The handle is easy to grip and hold and maneuver.

I found it ok but the results were no better or no worse than curling irons Ive purchased at a fraction of the cost.  Of course it does come with a heat proof one-size-fits-all glove for your hand and a heat proof mat to lay on your counter to prevent burns.  The auto-shut-off is pretty standard for most units these days.

I was surprised that the unit did not have an adjustment for heat level.  It just gets hot to the max.  I was reluctant to use this high heat setting but found I got the curl I wanted in only about 8-10 seconds so I adjusted (as opposed to the unit).

The hot surface area is covered with little bumps that serve the purpose of hanging on to your hair.  I think that for my very fine hair they did ok.  The unit feels comfortable in the hand.

It also comes with a pad to lay the wand on, a glove to protect your hand (which I do not use), and an auto shut off.

So while this wand works great for me, there are a few things I am not crazy about:

>No heat setting (it automatically heats up to 360 degrees so you cannot go higher or lower if you wish). While this setting works for me, I know a few folks who would prefer higher / lower.

>The on / off button is a bit odd. You switch it on, and it will blink. Once it stops blinking , that is your sign that it is ready to use. The blinking light is a little bit hard to see and the button is located where my thumb constantly hits. Not a deal breaker but just something I noticed.

Kept hoping someone would finally just make skin care that would help my pores,
without piling more make up on my face.
Bioderma is that thing that listened to me & I'm sure many others.

I don't know quite how to explain it, as it does something, nothing has ever done before.
It mattes your skin without drying yet it feels soft & taken care of.
And pores, on a clean, no make-up face seem to blend into your skin.
Under make-up, with no primer, it doesn't peel or roll just gives a flawless base.

I have huge pores on my forehead & nose from years of oily Tzone.
I have become an expert at make up coverage but always just wanted my best face, naturally.
I've used glycolic masks & microderm scrubs but once the pores are there, they are there.

I used this 2 ways. Daytime under make up & Nightime to sleep.
Both times, washed with Cetaphil foam, then patted (not rubbed) Bioderma into forehead & nose only.

At night, applied eye & face cream before bed, woke up to smoother texture on Bioderma areas.
No burning, itching, irritation & I have annoyingly sensitive skin.
The weird part was, it felt like my skin's natural oils were actually helping my skin with the Bioderma.

Did a couple differerent daytime routines.
One with full make up and the other, brush & go.
Full make up, patted my primer/ foundation on top of Bioderma areas
Got same wear. The Bioderma performed just like any other moisturizer I would use
yet, made pore areas disappear.

Brush & go was impressive.
No primer, just Bioderma, under eye concealer & OFRA banana powder. (See note * on banana powder.)
All I can say is, I ran into a work friend at Costco who thought I looked photoshopped.
May be my new favorite go to combo.

*If you never used banana powder, try it. Even a novice can make it work with cotton ball application.
It hides every flaw on your face & somhow doesn't settle in even eye area lines.*

giving you high end make up results, naturally.",1524528000,,Bioderma S&eacute;bium  Pore Refiner Cream - 1 fl. oz.,Luxury Beauty,$19.90,2018/04/24,0.0018370592780630175

This has wonderful coverage - it looks as though you've used a primer underneath.

It also goes on easily, blends in without creating lines, and stays on. (I use a foundation brush, which I believe works better than anything else).

My only complaint is that it is hard to tell which color to get by just looking at the photos. My skin color is fair and cool, but I usually go slightly darker to avoid looking like a ghost. I got the Sand color which is unfortunately a bit too dark and warm-toned for my just-emerging-from-winter skin color. I am pretty sure the color will work in the summertime when my skin gets darker anyway, but for now I feel I erred with the color. I wish there was a better description of the colors or underlying tones.

Two others that I like quite a lot and can compare this to are Clinique's Even Better Glow and Lumene's Instant Glow Beauty Serum.
Lumene's is thinner consistency and sheerer than this, which is more like the Clinique product.

Its possible that, as I get a little darker in the summer, it might be a better match. Right now, I had to remove some of it (using a slightly moist cotton pad) because it was a poor match for my skin color. The light beige color, which sounds like it should be a good match for me is OK in intensity but leans towards a light-colored band aid color that has too much tint for my skin. Objectively speaking, I have more yellow in my skin and this shade has more brownish-pink.

It is easy to apply. It goes on smoothly without leaving tracks or demarcation lines. The more you smooth it on, the better it absorbs. I like the way it evens out skin color. I have tiny little red veins that make me look as if Im overdoing the blush powder and this crme covers it up without a painted-on look (even though it is less yellow than it should be). It also fills the pores just enough for smoothness and without looking artificial. I have very dry skin, but it feels light when wearing it and is easy to remove at the end of the day. Even though I was at an outdoor event that started during a warm late afternoon and went on to around 11 in the evening, the coverage was undisturbed by sweating or the passage of time. Photographs taken (with a lens that is very unforgiving) looked natural and did not reflect flash spots. Many friends commented on how good and relaxed I looked and asked if I had lost weight. Go figure!

The one star that I took off a perfect rating was not for the color mis-match. It is because it is only a finish. Granted, it is a good finisha little face powder and maybe blush and you're at your absolute best. But it doesnt contain SPF protection (a must in Florida) or a moisturizer (although, frankly, it feels soft as if it doesmaybe its the hyaluronic acid?). You must first lay a foundation of those basic products and then add this as the final touchtoo many steps for everyday use.

I think I have found ""The One"".

I have been using some pretty nice cover foundations, but they all can make me pasty, and my pores enlarged; not always, but at times, which is strange.  I now have products I can mix with those makeups to make me look more radiant, but I like this hydrating liquid makeup more.  I have dry skin, and my tired 63-year-old skin with sunspots needs perking up, and toning down all at once.  I had the most amazing day, trying this on with some other products, and together, I really loved the look.  I will always say yes to looking younger, and not sallow.  At my age this is a real treat.  I'm not one to try new products on my own, due to my never having found adequate foundations.  I've had better luck more recently with another great brand, and I have tried this brand before, with their moisturizers, and such, so this is a good experience all around.  My dermatologist recommends this brand: La Roche-Posay.

I have zero doubts about this one, which is the perfect shade for me.  I suppose it would be nice if it was a bigger tube of course, but what I am getting here is more precious.  Youth at my age.  Creamy liquid foundation that makes me glow.

I've mixed this with a sample of La Roche-Posay moisturizer, rival brand luminous drops, some contour, and very little makeup necessary for me this time.  No need for heavy makeup when my skin looks nice!  I am simply in heaven.

I have been using this brands BB creams for years. While I love those, although they could cover a little better, Im not a big fan of this one. It goes on more difficulty than the BB cream, and I have to use more product too. This foundation also clings to any dry skin illuminating it.

With just a few colors available it was hard to tell which color would work best for me and I could not find shade swatches anywhere, and Amazon pics only show one shade in all the different pics, so I ordered the Sand-Sable color available to me, but when it arrived it is not a perfect match. However, the next shade up seemed too dark.

I use several liquid foundations in the same price range and I am not very impressed with this one. My favorites in this price range are MAC Studio Fix Fluid and MAC Waterweight, in shade NC30 or NC35 in summer. They are more full coverage vs. this foundation. Waterweight is very spreadable and more comparable to this one but I still think it gives better coverage as it hides my redness better than the La Roche-Posay. I also like Clinique foundations, I use Clinique Even Better Glow Foundation in Nuetral or Honey shade that has slight luminiscence and lighter coverage than this foundation but better spreadability.

You couldn't get me to switch even if you paid me. With that being said, I've been trying to find a good alternative in case the dreadful event ever turns up that they discontinue my favorite product (which has happened with other products that I loved, and it's devastating). I have yet to find a comparable product until I received this one.

I was so skeptical given the track record that I had with trying alternative brands, which often failed to live up to my standards of a good foundation. Needless to say I was in utter shock how much I liked this product. Finding the right color tone and consistency is also a problem for me. I was worried that this would either be too light or too dark, but it was spot on for my fair complexion (although sun kissed skin in the summer may change this slightly). Don't let the initial thin constancy fool you, either. This stuff provides full coverage and conceals minor imperfections. I didn't even have to blend any foundation lines at my jawline.

You can build the coverage but I prefer a light foundation so I really like that it's not super heavy and it does not settle into fine lines on my aging skin.

The lifting gel I only use at night because it dries like a glue holding your face in shape but it glossy and visible. The mister is nice, especially through winter and smells pleasant.  One bonus for me is while running this along my cheeks and jaw bone it stimulates my saliva glands which for me is a good thing as I suffer from dry mouth.

They actually don't leave any marks at all while giving a nice rejuvenating facial massage leaving the skin fresh, oxygenated and supple while the other side of the unit helps to stimulate using a bristle-less wavy feel which leaves the skin warm and oxygenated helping to reduce fine lines and wrinkles.

I don't use cleaning products on my face at all, but the exfoliation is very important in skin rejuvenation so what I do is rub ice on my face for about 2 minutes and then use the exfoliator brush side to ""clean"" it for another 2-3 minutes, after which I put olive oil and use the gentle wrinkle side to warm and smooth the oil into my skin.

The Luna Mini is easy to use and comfortable to hold. It has a button in the center to power on/off and to change speed. It has two pulsation speeds and three zones of silicone touch-points (brushes) for different skin type and sensitivity. The silicone touch-points are super soft and gentle on the skin. It takes about a minute to clean the face and has built-in pause signals to tell you to move to different areas of the face. It is also waterproof, so you can use it in the shower as well. The silicone material makes the brush easy to clean and be kept hygiene. A full charge lasts for a few months. It comes with a special USB cable for charging (the Luna Mini has a coaxial connector for charging).

All in all, this is an amazing product. I honestly wasn't expecting that this small and simple looking face brush would make such a difference in face cleaning.

I have been using a Clarisonic facial brush cleaner for quite a while now and while it also gets my face very clean, I hate the expense of buying new brushes and I worry about keeping the brushes really clean.

The Luna Mini is quite small but it does a great job. It has two sides for regular and deep cleaning. It has a timer that prompts you to move to the next section of your face. There are two speeds so even if you have delicate skin, you can probably use this without irritation. It's completely waterproof so you can use it in the tub or shower.

When I first opened this Luna Mini, I didn't think it could possibly get my skin as clean as the Clarisonic because the silicone brushes just feel so soft. I took it to the shower, wet the brush and applied my facial cleanser and then began cleaning my face. It felt so gentle that again, I didn't think it would get my face clean but surprise! It did a fabulous job of getting my face amazingly clean. I also used it on my body with my regular bar soap and it worked wonderfully.

I have skin that tends toward being oily and I have found that getting my skin squeaky clean and then applying a good, acne lotion prevents almost all breakouts. This Luna Mini gets my skin squeaky clean. However, people with dry, delicate skin can use the lower speed and the gentle side and a moisturizing, facial cleanser to avoid drying out their skin while still cleansing away of all the daily dirt and makeup.

I came out of the shower with a rosy glow and my skin looked and felt wonderful.

It has an internal, rechargeable battery. It comes with a USB charging cable that you will either need to plug into a computer or a USB a/c adapter in order to use however, you can order a replacement charger that has an a/c plug on the end. Mine arrived almost fully charged - it only took 30 minutes longer to fully charge it. As far as I can tell, the battery is not user replaceable.

I love that it's so easy to clean. Just use soap and water and rinse well and then allow to air dry. FOREO doesn't say anything about this but I clean my silicone kitchen wear with alcohol from time to time with no adverse effects and I likely will do the same with this device.

It also comes in a nice, clear plastic storage box which is good for travel.

One disappointment is that the included instructions are printed in minuscule print. Go to the FOREO website and you'll find blessedly large instructions for use.

I'm so, so happy with this device! I'll be giving my Clarisonic to someone else.",1516060800,,FOREO LUNA mini Silicone Face Brush with Facial Cleansing for All Skin Types,Luxury Beauty,$69.30,2018/01/16,0.009415051661626806

The high quality fragrance remains consistent after multiple hours of wear on bare skin and clothing.  It does not decompose into powdery or artificial scents like cheaper perfumes.  I would characterize it as a youthful and flirty, fit for all occasions.  Had I encountered it during my dating life, I would have been swept off my feet.

I tested a small dab on myself and a full spray on my wife.  The scent was strong up to the first four hours, and gently declines until it is just a hint after 12 hours.  The EDP concentration rating is the strongest available, and one spray should last all day.

Advice from a former perfume seller- if you buy Carven for below full price from other sellers, beware that the bottles are often sourced from other countries and there is no guarantee of authenticity.  Go to Neiman or Nordstroms to smell the true scent if buying it for the first time, and don't hesitate to complain to Amazon if you receive a dud.",1528156800,,"Carven Le Parfum for Women Eau de Parfum Spray, 3.33 oz",Luxury Beauty,$114.00,2018/06/05,0.008567392527720355

Strivectin is a well-known name in skin products, since its beginnings as a company that just produced a skin cream to reduce stretch marks.  Now they have branched out into any number of skincare products.

According to its description, this Advanced Retinol Eye Cream has been proven to (1) deliver benefits of retinol without skin irritation, (2) minimize fine lines and crow's feet, (3) firm and fortify the eye area, (4) nourish and hydrate, and (5) smooth and refine texture.  To make this sound even better, it has a patented NIA-114 technology to do all this.  (Yeah, I don't know what that is either.)

However, a reading of the list of ingredients, of which there are more than 50, does not inspire a lot of confidence that this is truly revolutionary.  Other than the retinol, it looks like the usual ingredients for skin creams, some of them perfectly innocuous, some of them slightly iffy.

But how does it work?  Does this grandmother have minimized fine lines, smoother and more refined skin texture, less visible signs of aging around the eyes?  Well, to be perfectly honest, I don't notice that this works any better than many less expensive eye products I've used in the past.  And, even though I only use a very small amount under each eye (maybe a dab the size of a sesame seed), it takes quite a while to be absorbed.  It feels somewhat greasy and looks somewhat shiny, and, if I put on mascara, there is sometimes smearing when the eyelashes touch the moisturized skin under my eyes.

After I have used up this sample, I won't be purchasing it again.  Considering its high price, I don't consider it effective enough.  What I really need is to get enough sleep.  That's what makes these old eyes of mine look better.

I started off with the Proraso green, which I loved, but wanted to try others and ordered the red and white soaps. My skin tends to be dry, and I thought the more moisturizing red formula would be a good fit. First, it has a fantastic sandalwood fragrance. Woodsy, warm, and spicy, but not overpowering. The soap lathers very easily & produces a creamy, rich lather. Unfortunately for me, for some reason this particular formulation causes irritation, and each time I used it, I ended up with razor burn and prickly, irritated skin.

Both Retinol and Reinoids are made from Vitamin A and it's the best thing available to reduce wrinkles and age spots.  Retinoids are the stronger variety that requires a prescription (Retin-A, Tazorac, etc.)  Retinol is the light duty variety that is good for daily use if you don't want to bother with a prescription.  Since Retinol promotes the growth of healthy new cells, your skin can get sensitive with these baby cells exposed on the surface, so it is important to stay out of the sun or wear sunscreen when using this product.

I really like this product.  It is a smooth and soft application from one pump which isn't really a lot from this generous bottle, and I am seeing my skin look very nice in spite of the dehydration I normally experience because of medications and caffeine. I started using this awhile back and in between I have had a couple of incidents with peeling that I am not sure is 100% related, but it isn't significant, and certainly it would be expected according to the bottle. I am reading that this particular dose of Retinol is generous, so I can see this being kind of pricey.  But this is well-worth the money in my opinion.  I haven't experienced any burning from applications, and have used it most nights.  However  I don't recommend sunning, or at least not all at once, because I sunburned easily the other day, which caused my peeling, possibly related to this product, and it was accompanied by some scratchy-feeling sensitive skin, which I treated with applications of baby oil and no more sun.  The problem disappeared within one day. The previous peeling problem might not be traced back to this night product necessarily, because there was another product that I used within an hour of the peeling, so I had attributed it to that product at the time.

When I am using a night cream product, I like a bit of tacky which won't be greasy and rub off during the night.  I am looking for a product that is compatible to my dry, aging skin, and I like soft skin the next morning.  Having an extra benefit of the Retinol is a much appreciated bonus due to its anti-aging benefits. This SkinMedica product from E-Salon LLC, fits that bill.  Nice product, and I would order it again.  Enjoy.",1526688000,,"SkinMedica Retinol 0.5 Complex, 1 oz.",Luxury Beauty,$78.00,2018/05/19,0.007386752973389243

My skin tingles when I put it on, and I actually experienced a bit of mild peeling using this, which is remarkable because I hardly experience any at this point with the actual Retin-A.

The `Strength Cure` line has over the top claims (in the end, just the scissors will `repair` damaged hair), but manages to provide decent shampoo and conditioner formulas. I somewhat felt my hair strengthened (they're the kind of product that give body to hair), I think that `velvety soft finish` is kind of a good description. But I have frizzy hair, and while it left it hydrated, I prefer shampoos/conditioners that help me with that as well.
The shampoo did a nice thick lather and cleaned my hair surprisingly well. Pureology shampoos (from which I tried) are not the kind that leave hair squeaky clean. I have sensitive scalp with a tendency to get dandruff, the shampoo didn't aggravated my itchiness.
The conditioner wasn't very thick and even my thin hair basically absorbed quickly everything. When I rinsed it off, I felt my hair very smooth, almost covered in a silicone like layer. Once dried, my hair was hydrated, but very frizzy, so I needed to follow with a leave-in conditioner.

Pureology usually has those aroma therapeutic scent blends that I just dislike, too strong, But the `Strength Cure` had a milder scent, a hint of herby lavender and honey; I personally also felt a bit of nettle in there.

It's worth carrying with you if you're using the Leg and Body makeup, because I've found that that can rub off even if you've used the Dermablend powder or spray fixative, and you might need touchups. Like the Quick-Fix Concealer Stick, this goes on very smooth and generally stays put if you don't put a bunch of friction on it, and if you match the color it's dang near invisible.

Voila - it was quite the ""quick-fix"" for her problem.

She gently applied a thin layer over the scar (which is pink) against her very pale skin -- and this color matched her skin tone well. She waited a few minutes and then built more coverage with a couple of extra strokes. Then, following the directions, she set the foundation by applying a coat of transluscent face powder. You can barely see any blemish as the coverage is great. It makes her feel much more confident and that makes me happy too!

I'm not sure how well this item would do for extensive disfiguring blemishes, but it works well on the fairly superficial ones. Also ""erases"" visible capillaries such as those on the side of the nose, and other small imperfections much better than regular foundation products. You don't need a lot of it either.

The most important thing on this, though, is to get the right color match. I wish I could have tried this in the store because online it's hard to tell. Also something to keep in mind is the body is often a different color than the face so this was a bit too dark.

I received this Dermablend foundation stick free from the Amazon Vine program.  I like to use concealer to cover up a few dark spots on my face as well as some scars on my hands from a bad bicycle accident last summer (see photos).  Overall, this Dermablend foundation stick worked pretty well on my face, but I was disappointed at how quickly it came off my hands considering it is supposed to be water and smudge resistant.  Then I figured out why (amazing what reading the instructions will do) 

I did not realize the 16 hours of wear is achieved by using this Dermablend foundation stick in conjunction with setting powder.  I had never used setting powder before, but decided to order some to see if it made a difference with this foundation stick.  Instead of ordering Dermablend setting powder, I bought Maybelline, because it was less than a third of the Dermablend price.  Results were that it lasted a bit longer with the setting powder, and perhaps it would last even longer with Dermablend (versus Maybelline) setting powder.

For curiosity, I had my daughter cover up a tattoo with it.  It did not work at all.  The tattoo was still completely visible, even when using setting powder.

I tried it on my face as a normal foundation stick and also to cover some surgical scars for testing purposes. I do not have tattoos so I can't comment on coverage of them. I tested the makeup with three different blending methods- my finger, a beauty blender, and a foundation brush. The foundation brush provided the thickest single-coat coverage, but I preferred the slightly smoother look of the blender (though it required more product). It was easy to apply with all three of the methods.

Pros:
- Creamy, full coverage makeup without feeling caked on or thick. Coverage is very buildable-- just let it sit for a few minutes between coats and BLEND! Facial acne, undereye circles, and surgical scars completely disappeared using this product.
- Long, long, long lasting! If applied correctly (with setting powder), you will not need to touch up at all. It also held out during a particularly nasty rainy day. Though it is long lasting, I didn't have to scrub hard to get it off at the end of the day. It was easily removed with makeup removing cloths.
- Didn't clog my pores. Full coverage foundation scares this acne-prone girl, so it's always exciting when a product is actually truthful about its noncomedogenic status.

I purchased all sample shampoo and conditioner available because I wanted to see if the results would be that great using ORIBE products at home.

The shampoo did a decent job at cleaning my hair and scalp, with a lush but not too thick foam; I did need to lather twice to get a good clean. But it's expected that a shampoo targeted for colored hair is not the most cleansing possible (to preserve color).
The conditioner was OK, but didn't managed to moisturize enough my thin frizzy hair.
The `Beautiful Color` shampoo and conditioner gave more texture/grip, making my hair looking matte and being more tangled than usual. The hair was soft, but the results were not better than drugstore hair products. My hair was also limp, with no volume.

It is not as strong as some other tanners, the change in color after one coat is slight, but after a couple applications the color is significant.",1528156800,,"St. Tropez Self Tan Express Advanced Bronzing Mousse, 6.7 Fl Oz",Luxury Beauty,$44.00,2018/06/05,0.008567392527720355

630,1473,5,"05 24, 2018",A1F7YU6O5RU432,B00KSS3MJ0,Where the Sidewalk Ends,"I've been a fan of St Tropez for many years. I've used just about every version they sell, and many they don't even make any more. When you're trying to get an even color on your body, the foam tanners are the way to go. Everything else (sprays, lotions, wipes, etc) feels just impossible to not end up with streaks at least somewhere on your body. But to get the perfect non-streak color with these foam formulas, I high recommend one of the foam application mitts. There's just something about how they work with the foam that helps blend everything evenly.

What I like about this formula is that you can adjust the depth of your tan by how long you leave it on. When you have a very fair skin tone (like myself) and then one day you show up somewhere with a dark tan, people realize you probably used a bottled product to get your color. So I like going gradual. But again, I'm not a huge fan of the lotion formulas. So this bronzing foam version is a great solution. I can wash it off after an hour and the next day I have just a little bit of color. Then when it's time to reapply a few days later for touch-ups, I can leave it on a little longer and get a little darker color.

Just as important as the applicator mitt (not something that comes with this tanner, it's sold separately) is exfoliating before application. I know, it's a pain to go through these extra steps. But if you exfoliate before applying your tanner, it makes all the difference in the world. Your tan's color comes out much more even, and it doesn't end up patchy as your tan starts to fade and you exfoliate. Taking these extra few steps is very much with it.",1527120000,,"St. Tropez Self Tan Express Advanced Bronzing Mousse, 6.7 Fl Oz",Luxury Beauty,$44.00,2018/05/24,-0.0023572205679487208

So, I'm no stranger to self tanner, I've tried many types of the years just to put a touch of color to my legs that seem to always being paler than my arms. During application the color of this product is a bit off putting but thankfully there is no swampy green color left on the skin after rinsing. I did it in my usual way, exfoliate thoroughly then apply with a mitt. I did feel like I was getting better coverage and liked the consistency more than my previous favorite which was lotion style. I left it on just shy of an hour and was pleased that it was light and even. It is on the pricey side but honestly I've yet to find an inexpensive self tanner that doesnt turn me some shade of orange so I feel it is worth the extra cost.

I am very familiar with sunless tanners and used St. Tropez tan foam with a mitt for the application.  On the first application, I only had time to put it on for an hour but had planned to have it on for three.  I felt really sticky with it on and wanted to rinse it off.  I was very impressed that the tanner left my skin darker than my ""dark tanner"" that I leave on all night frequently.  I am not a fan that it feels a little sticky and I cannot wear certain clothes because it has a bit of a residue.  However, it leaves a wonderful gleam on my skin that looks healthy and natural.  My skin looks healthy, hydrated, and cared for. Foams usually do not last as long as sprays and I prefer to have more on hand.  I also notice that its hard to tell when foams will run out so I am not sure I like that it is a form of application.  I will update with time but the color is beautiful, natural, and it actually lasts like a tan.
Pros-
1. very dark and natural tan achieved unbelievably fast
2. smells like perfume without as much of a sunless tanner smell
Cons-
1. quite sticky when on until rinse
2. If you miss a spot it is noticeable because of the drastic difference in tone. However, it is pretty easy to blend.
3.  watch out for your elbows, knees, and edges of wrists because it grabs color in those areas.

634,1477,4,"05 17, 2018",A2F0E69BAX0T0T,B00KSS3MJ0,Dan Leithauser,"I may not be the typical user of self tanning lotions.  After a winter of not getting much sun, I like to put a little color on my snow white old man legs so I do not blind others when I am wearing shorts.  Over the years, I have come to like and dislike any number of things regarding these products.
First, my likes.  I like mousse over lotions. St. Tropez Self Tan Express Advance Bronzing Mousse is definitely a mousse.  Mousses go on easily with simple disposable gloves, generally do not streak too much, and dry quickly without stickiness.  Lotions vary a lot in those characteristics.  I also like less initial colorant over the active ingredient DHA.  It is the final color that is left after you wash it off that is more important than the initial color. A higher concentration of DHA should mean quicker and darker results.  For those people that may want that instant tan and want to head out immediately, the colorant is important.  St. Tropez has a typical amount.  Me? I put it on and let it react for 3-4 hours then wash it off.

Now, for my dislikes.  Universally, all of these products have tons of fragrance.  I guess it is to cover up an unnatural odor of the raw ingredients (but I do not know).  St. Tropez is a tropical fruity odor which, while not objectionable, is strong, and (personally) I would not venture outside the house with it on.  This is the way it is with all self tanners I have tried, so it is not a knock for the current product, just one of my dislikes.  I also do not like stuff that runs too much -- hence the mousse.  If you use a liquid, you need to do it in a shower or tub to avoid other surfaces that you may not be able to wash easily.  (Colorant on a white carpet?!)

For the St. Tropez, the mousse goes on smooth and easy.  It dried in a matter of minutes.  The fragrance as noted is strong but not unpleasant -- but you will be smelling it until you take a shower!  The tan it leaves after a shower is as natural as it gets for self tanners -- for me a slight brown to orange color -- just enough color to keep the snow white quality down while the natural sunlight produces some real color on my legs.  Most people do not notice that it is not a ""real tan"", unless you applied it unevenly or missed a spot.  Generally, at the beginning of shorts season I tend to reapply about once every 7-10 days.

I like the St. Tropez Self Tan Express Advance Bronzing Mousse.  It is what I expected -- easy to put on, it dries moderately quickly, and when washed off the resultant color is great.  The price is a bit a steeper than a competitive and similar mousse from St. Moriz, so minus a star.",1526515200,,"St. Tropez Self Tan Express Advanced Bronzing Mousse, 6.7 Fl Oz",Luxury Beauty,$44.00,2018/05/17,-0.0026321948980256187

So, I leave it on for longer than the recommended 3 hours. But that's how I handle other tanners, too.

I use a glove that has a thumb in it by Dave's sold on Amazon. It seems tho be the easiest and best I've found. (If Amazon deletes what I wrote, do a search for taking mitt and look for the one with a thumb).

It's like all tanners - be careful around ankles, knees, elbows, knuckles, etc.  I don't have a problem with it fading oddly, but I keep my skin well moisturized.  I do not put lotion on before the tanner, like others too. I just put moisturizer on my body every time I get out of the shower.  I guess my skin stays moisturized enough from that.

They all tell you to exfoliate.
No need to buy an exfoliating product unless you have the skin of an alligator.

Scrub with a poof & moisturize well after.
Add extra lotion to hands, feet, ankles, knees & elbows.
After it absorbs into your skin, like an hour. Apply self tanner & rub until you see no streaks or marks. Dry skin is what causes the uneven look.

This is a light & airy mousse and very easy to rub in. I used circular motion just, tends to blend better. Left no stain on my fingers & dried quickly.

I forgot the test spot was there until I saw it in the pool the next day bc it did naturally blend into my skin.
I do have light to medium skin tone but working outside in Florida, I always have a base even with piles of sunscreen.

St Tropez is known for being one of the Premier brands for natural looking tan.

Still, the fine crepey lines were still there and my neck did not look tighter. While I didn't expect a change to my profile or age-related sagging, since that's impossible with a skin cream, I hoped the crepey appearance would be improved. I'm assuming this topical cream contains an ingredient that tightens as it dries, much like the egg white trick.

I was curious about the claims in the description, such as stating 86 percent felt tighter skin. I wrote the company to ask how many people were surveyed, was this a clinical study, and what were the average ages of those who participated. It's been 10 days and they still have not responded.

This is not a product that I would recommend to my own family and friends. I found that it did not live up to the claims of tightening my skin.

I regret that I didn't think to try it on one side of my neck for comparison purposes. My neck skin feels tighter as advertised. My impression is for those with serious wrinkles, this may decrease the depth of those wrinkles without being able to make them disappear. I think it will make the skin feel tighter regardless.

Also, it's an easier product to use than a chemical peel. Chemical peels work best to treat acne and skin discolorations, I feel. I don't have enough experience with retinol creams to offer a comparison of them to StriVectin.

This particular line is geared toward problem skin (acne).  mask contains the following ingredients:
Glycolic acid and salicylic acid are effective agents for combating acne.
Sulfur which soothes inflammation and painful lesions, and it works to calm red, irritated skin.
Hyaluronic acid hydrates the skin, so it doesnt become dry while lesions are being dried and reduced.
Kaolin helps to decrease the amount of oil on the skin.
Manuka extract is antibacterial, and it serves to keep acne from returning.
Peppermint leaf helps to counteract redness, and rosemary works to heal lesions and restore skin that has sustained damage
I use the mask during occasional breakups that I experience in a summer time during exercise and sweating when pores tend to clog more easily.  Product is effective.  This mask comes in a large quantity and it can last for a really long time even if it is used several times a week.

I work hard to keep my face clean, though between sweat and my tendency to sleep against my hands, I nevertheless develop my fair share of zits and general acne issues that require treatment. This masque requires a bit more effort than my in-shower scrub, but it's pretty straightforward to use and so far I am pleased with the results.

Like most of my acne medication, the only active ingredient here is 2% salicylic acid. You start by washing your face, which I did with a soft washcloth. Then you apply the masque, which reminded me a bit of wet concrete. It's gritty, as one would expect, relatively thick, and sort of a dull gray color. Fortunately, it did not smell bad. It was vaguely minty or perhaps a little herbal in scent - not the greatest smell in the world, but it was nothing that bothered me for the length of time it was on my face. You leave the masque in place for five to ten minutes, which was pretty easy for me, being a first-time masque user. After that, I removed it as instructed with water - it was not difficult to come off as I feared it might be - though I did not do the recommended cold splash of water after its removal because I just didn't want to do that. You are apparently able to use this as needed one to three times a week, and it can also be used as a spot treatment for ""active lesions.""

Overall, after using this a couple of times, I am pleased to say that it did not dry out my skin as some acne treatments have in the past. A tiny pimple forming on my forehead rapidly receded after a couple days, which was very pleasing.

I'm a yellow toned light-medium complexion (MAC NC20, maybe NC25 in the summer) and the light /medium shade in the BB Blur is a little too dark for me. Since it's a BB cream, the color kind of adapts to my skin, but the coverage is light to medium, so it still looks off if it's not a match.

I am a big fan of SkinMedicas TNS Essential Serum and used to use it years ago. I only stopped because it got too costly, so I was eager to give this a try.

This sunscreen feels great going on; its just the perfect texture and easily glides on your face. I was a happy camper the morning I put this on and went out and  took my dog out for a walk.

I wasn't a happy camper for long.  I was only outside with my dog for maybe 1/2 an hour and it was a fairly cloudy day, but by later on that afternoon my skin started itching and the telangiectasia on my face became very noticeable. I looked flushed for a while and had to put various anti-itch creams on to calm it down.

Because I wanted to make sure I hadnt done anything wrong or that maybe the sunscreen was reacting with something I had put on beforehand, I waited a week and applied a small part to my face and the same thing happened again.

So I know this isn't for me as much as I wish it was - because I do believe SkinMedica puts out such quality products.

After all it purports to nourish the skin 39% more after a months worth of use. The consistency of the product is not oily like I thought it would be. Its more like any shower gel. BUT it does not produce much lather like your typical shower gel either if you simply use this directly in your skin. It does lather if you use it on a sponge or loofah. If you want to see immediate results for your dry skin, you will need to use the soap directly on your skin and you have to use quite a bit when compared to liquid soap or shower gels.
However, my skin does not feel dry after the shower. Ive used enough soaps (mass market as well as high-end artisanal soaps) to know what a cheaply made product would feel like on your skin. This shower oil is definitely not harsh on your skin nor does it strip the natural oils off your surface. I like the pleasant, mild scent - though Id rather they remove the parfum. There is no need for that at all. People will buy this to nourish their skin - so don't add fragrances just coz you have to.
The product makers state it can be used on faces of babies and children. I got some into my eye to test if it stings. It does. Not the harsh burning sensation of soaps, but this product still does sting. So use it on your kids if you must, but be aware to avoid getting this anywhere close to their eyes.
33 oz costs $20. But you will make quick work of the 33 oz. It will probably last for 33-35 days if you use it directly or double that time if you use it with a loofah. I will try it for 30 days - if it changes the way my skin feels then Id rate it 5 stars.

I decided to purchase it. Honestly, I don't like the scent at all. It's a powdery, musky, hint of vanilla scent(older lady). It also lingers.

I don't know if it's stronger than the RED in terms of hold, because they both seem to do the same job to me, and hold for the same amount of time(shine maybe a bit less on the blue?).

I will update this if my impressions change, as I'm only on my 3rd day using the BLUE. If I do buy Reuzel again, it will probably be the RED though, because I find that scent a bit less offensive.

While this lotion is too expensive for me to use year-round, it's wonderful in winter to soothe my itchy arms and legs and heal my cracked hands. I didn't find it sticky, as some reviewers did, but I'm usually negligent about my skin until it's gotten so dry I can't ignore the itching, so maybe with drier skin it absorbs more readily. I've found colloidal oatmeal products to be tacky though soothing, and this doesn't fall into that camp. One thing I really like about this product is that it won't irritate my skin if I've let it get so dry that it's sensitive. There are other dry skin products I use that are great with regular use, but irritate my skin if I've let it get too dry. This just soaks in and stops the itch.

Aside from excessive dryness and the accompanying sensitivity, I don't have any chronic skin conditions. This seems to be targeted more toward more serious skin issues, where the added expense would be more worthwhile year-round. For simple dryness, it makes more sense to use a cheaper product (i.e., whatever reasonably creamy lotion is on sale); but for winter itch, it's top notch and worth the price.

You get four products that are bigger than hotel size offerings but small enough to throw in your purse or overnight bag .. so the price is steep. Still, as another review states, tiny dabs do the trick so these should last.

Youth Activating Melon Serum reminds us that premium products demand premium outrageous names but it is, by far, the coolest product. The serum is a pastel tangerine with tiny beads floating throughout. Twist the cap and a pump pops up. Use it twice a day, applying to clean skin; it tightens the skin but doesn't really moisturize; it's not an entirely pleasant feeling. 1/2 ounce. Made in France.

The Overnight Retinol Repair Creme (another premium name!) is the best product. It feels great and smells delicious. 1/3 ounce. Made in Canada.

The Environmental Protecting Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Sunscreen has the longest name (it barely fits on the tube!) and serves the most ambitious task: protecting you from UV rays, pollution, and smartphone, TV and computer screen hev light -- while it moisturizes! This smells like traditional sunscreen lotion and does feel good on the skin. Personally, I ONLY use moisturizers with a good spf rating anymore. 1/2 ounce. Made in Canada.

The Intensive Triple Exfoliating Treatment combines glycolic acid, papaya enzymes and silica beads. I have fair, mixed skin and this was too intense for me. My skin felt like paper afterward, similar to what it does after clay. This exfoliant is great for oily skin. Maybe others could add a few drops of oil to the mix .. or give it to a swarthy friend :-) 1/2 ounce. Made in Canada.

These are high quality products. I deduct one star for several reasons: the price, the mixed nature of the products (it'd be better to have one set for oily skin and another for dry), and the ingredients.

I decided to try this one because I was interested in the cleanser and night cream.  I didn't like that there wasn't a detailed, but simple description of each product on the Amazon page.  Instead there was a long blah-blah-blah description of leaf serum.  You have to purchase the box to see each item and what they do.  I did get this from Amazon to test for free in lieu of an honest review.

I also have to wear glasses and I hate that I have to wear my glasses to in front of the bathroom sink to read the directions on what each one does.  Take a hint Meaningful Beauty.  We're old.  We have wrinkles.  We're farsighted!

I used the exfoliating cream felt nice and didn't burn my face like others have in the past.  It did seem to work on my neck which felt smoother.

I then used the cleanser.  It was crap.  It didn't really clean anything.  I put it on showered and put my nail to my face because it felt like there was a film on it.  Nope, the film was actually my foundation still on my face.

I faired better with the SPF 30 moisturizer.  It was light and went nicely with my foundation.  We did a lot better here.  But...we'll get to that in a minute.

The night cream went on heavier than the Oil of Olay I normally use.  I had to take an extra minute washing my face in the morning.  I don't know if that is bad or good.  it felt like it was on top of my skin if that makes sense.

I did use this for five days and let me tell you, for $54 bucks the product goes fast.  Now for the ""but"".  First I got one pimple on my cheek.  Then I got one on the side of my face between my ear and eye.  Not happy since I haven't had a pimple in about a year.

The device is 5 inches tall, 1 5/8 inches wide, and covered in silicone in the color of your choice. Each treatment takes one minute, 30 seconds on each eye. The gadget has two modes: Spa Mode (press once), which combines the tapping with vibration, and Pure Mode (press twice), in which the massager simply wiggles to create a sensation similar to tapping. According to Foreo, the Spa Mode is for older customers who need a little more help around the eyes. You can also adjust the frequency of the tapping/wiggling with plus and minus buttons, but you will probably not use those.

First, read the instructions if you can. I required a magnifying glass to read the enclosed user manual. The downloadable manual on Foreo's web site is more legible. Second, charge your massager. This requires a USB charger; it won't plug directly into an A/C outlet. Foreo claims that one charge will last up to 140 uses or 140 minutes. That's possible. I've been using mine for 3 weeks (about 20 uses), and it's still going strong. Press the center indentation to turn the device on. Press twice if you prefer Pure Mode. Apply some moisturizer or serum to the eye area. Move the massager along the brow bone above the eye and underneath the eye just above the bone until the massager skips or pauses. This indicates that 30 seconds have passed, and you should move to the other eye. After one minute, you will feel 3 skips. The device turns itself off after 3 minutes. Wash the Iris with soap and water.

It is better to use moisturizer than serum, as serum will soak in before you get to the second eye. You want some lubricant to be present. Otherwise, the silicone tugs at the skin. Foreo claims that this tapping and vibrating helps eye creams absorb better, but I don't know why it would. I found the Spa Mode uncomfortable. The Pure Mode was less so. I'm in my forties and showing some puffiness under my eyes. I tried the Iris to see if it might improve circulation enough to reduce the puffiness. After three weeks of using the massager once daily, I do not see any difference in puffiness, and it is uncomfortable to use. If it felt good, it would have redeeming value, but it doesn't.

When I first read this, I had the impression that this may be more of an infrared/light therapy... somewhat misleading as this is really just a vibrating/messaging silicone massager.

I pushed on it at different angles and with a bit of pressure and it finally started to work properly.  After the first few times struggling with it the switch does loosen up and become easier.  Once on the Iris massager moves and vibrates to massage the areas around your eyes.  My wife is trying this on one eye to see if there is a noticeable difference.  So far with just a few days of use there is no change but I will update this review after a few weeks of her using the product.  I will update my original one star review to 2.5 stars since it has started to work now.

There are a lot of massagers that you can buy with some that are as cheap as a few dollars and others that go well into the hundreds.  This Foreo Iris massager is definitely a luxury product with its $100 plus price tag.  The packaging was nice and up to par with its price as was the quality of the soft touch material that this is made of.  Unfortunately the battery in the Foreo Iris is defective.  I followed the instructions and charged this until the light stopped flashing and I was able to get this to work for all of 10 seconds before it stopped.  I thought that maybe the device had not fully charged so I tried charging this again.  Once it showed that it was done charging I tried turning the product on and nothing happened.  Unfortunately the quality control for the battery is subpar.  This would not be excusable on a $5 massager but on a $100 + device this is not acceptable.",1516147200,,"FOREO IRIS Illuminating Eye Massager, T-Sonic, Anti-age &amp; Fatigue",Luxury Beauty,$139.00,2018/01/17,-0.0016163899808150006

It is supposed to emulate a two-finger massage for under your eye, but that's not what it feels like. The ""fingers"" are rough and mechanical (Obviously) and it actually kind of hurts. It's also not the most comfortable thing to hold while moving it around your eyes.

The silicone finish stays clean, and the device seems solidly made, albeit in China.

All that said, the massager does not offer any unique features.

It also has a soft vibration combined w the patting as well, on the ""Spa Mode.""  The ""Pure Mode"" only has the patting w/o the background vibration.

When you get this, you are supposed to unlock it by pressing the faint plus and minus symbols on top and on bottom of the depression that is the  On/Function/Off button. Mine had no power, so I plugged it in for a few hours until the clear plastic pad on the bottom stopped flashing white and became a solid white light.  A power cord is provided, which has a USB on one side and a rounded charging plug on the other, but you need your own USB plug that fits into a wall socket. After charging, I pressed the minus and plus symbols for 3 seconds to try to unlock,  as well as the middle depression many times, and in various combinations, with no response. At some point, it did turn on, but I'm not sure what I did to make that happen. I'm guessing the locking mechanism is strong, and/or the buttons not very responsive.  When I did get it to turn on, I read the very tiny, tiny printed instructions that  say if you press the depression button once, you'll have Spa Mode, and a second push gives you Pure Mode.  In either mode, you can press the plus and minus areas to increase or decrease the intensity of the patting or vibrations. My video shows the Spa Mode.

Using this feels pretty good against my eye area, and even on different parts of my face, like the underside of my chin. It certainly is relaxing, and probably helps you just by removing some tension you might carry around in your face muscles. The movement is quite different from any other massager i've ever felt, so i think the fairly high price for this FOREO is what you'll pay for the unique action and sensation.  If you have facial tension, this will work great.  I think it helps me a lot in that regard, and will contribute to a more relaxed look, simply because it helps me relax my face. Overall, once I got this working, and understood the functions, it worked as advertised. The function buttons are a bit non-responsive- I need to press with some directed pressure, but that could be due to the whole thing being covered w a waterproof skin (feels smooth and soft- probably silicone).",1515715200,,"FOREO IRIS Illuminating Eye Massager, T-Sonic, Anti-age &amp; Fatigue",Luxury Beauty,$139.00,2018/01/12,-0.0035244874939864717

Plus, if you're using other cosmetic products  its always hard to know if this new product is solely responsible for any improvement.

Because of this, what I can say is whether or not something is irritating to the skin because thats important to know, especially if you have sensitive skin like I do. As to that, I can report back that this product is not irritating  which is great.

What is surprising about this product is that  I can report back after only 2 weeks of use that it is helping. I am able see an improvement, but only  to one particular part of my face - the smallish area above my upper lip.

At first I tried the product all over and it was so-so, But now If I use the product twice a day on the lines on the limited area over my upper lip it,  it actually helps. (Just remember, before you use this, clean the area by using either a lip sugar glazer and wiping it off or you use whatever else you want to use to make sure the area is very clean and any dead skin sloughed off.)

This has really helped puff up and helped the bleeding lines that sometimes show up on your upper lip when you put on lipstick or gloss and this is the first product that has done that. Mind you, the lines aren't completely gone, but there is an improvement.

On the negative side, if this product is applied too heavily (which isn't hard to do,) you can end up with it peeling/sloughing off - not a good look when you happen to look in the mirror.

In this case, the stretch mark cream was claimed also to help with wrinkles.

StriVectin has NIA-114, which is a form of Niacin/Vitamin B3 that may help the skin by strengthening the barriermaking the skin thicker or whatever so it is more like it was when it was younger.

You cant compare over-the-counter facial creams to the prescription retinoids, since the strength and effectiveness just aren't going to be the same, so best you can do is find over-the-counter creams that work almost as well, or with continued daily use maybe reach similar results over a longer period of time. So to that end, it makes it difficult to review a facial creams over-time effectiveness unless you wait the 3-4 months to see the difference it may make.

When I evaluate a face cream, serum, moisturizer, etc, I consider how it makes me feel, how it feels smoothing on my face, does it irritate my skin, the cost of the product, and are the claims it makes at any level working at allas in this case of StriVectin the immediate results claim.

Ive used this lotion over the last 3 days and though I don't have a lot of wrinkles, I do have aging skin. Evaluating it over my usual considerations:
1) It feels rather dry going on. Theres no luxe feel to it, but I do feel a bit of tightening to my skin, a little. I wish it were a little more luxe feeling for the price. That oh, this feels really nice feeling. However, the tightening feeling gives me the thought that something is working on some level to tighten my skin, even if temporary.
2) It does not irritate my skin. Theres not even a tingling or warming as I find with some creams. Only that slight tightening-dry feeling.
3) The cost is rather high for .5 oz of product. This is a tiny tube for about $60. For that price, Id like to see more dramatic immediate results, and Id like to know it is really going to do something I will actually notice weeks or months ahead, as now I tend to stare in the mirror after Ive applied it and think Is there a difference? I want to see the immediate results thing promised more definitively.

There may be a slight difference in the look of my skin on the immediate results level, but nothing dramatic. What Im more interested in is the long term effectiveness of the niacin/B3 (their NIA114). There is evidence that niacin/B has positive effects on the skin. At $60 for .5 oz, however, you could purchase a prescription strength retionol product and receive a more powerful punch for a better bargain. However, if your skin cannot tolerate the Retin-A types of products, then a lotion, serum, or cream with niacin/Bs may be great for you to try.

Im really on the fence about this product. Im not excited about it, nor do I think its worthless. But, overall, its not exciting me, or making me feel great about how it feels, enough to spend $60 on that tiny tube of product. So thats a 3-star for me.

Ill continue to use it daily until the product is gone. If I see any dramatic result, of course Ill return and report that, but I likely will return to other products that have quality ingredients for less cost. And consider a prescription-strength retinol treatment should I want those more dramatic results.

Thing is, the prescription strength products may seem as if they will be too expensive, but when you compare the cost per ounce of some of these products, like StriVectin, the better bargain is the prescription strength. Over-the-counter products make fantastic claims they cant always back up by science. But, they are effective in their own way, and good for those who would rather not mess with prescription strength products, or that those products are too harsh for their skin.

Id likely not purchase this product again but I will use it until its gone.",1523404800,2.0,"StriVectin High-Potency Wrinkle Filler Lotion, 0.5 oz.",Luxury Beauty,$59.00,2018/04/11,0.008250750130306374

First off, this is a good-size tub, which should last quite a while. A week in with twice daily use and Ive barely made a dent, so thats something. It also comes with a tiny plastic applicator, which is more sanitary than using your fingers, though I admit Im usually applying with freshly washed hands (and not sharing my cream) so, yeah, I do just normally dip in. (Partly because I forget I even have the scoop.)

This is thick, and rich, lotion but does absorb impressively well. My skin does feel very hydrated afterwards, but not greasy, which is all quite good. Not sure I saw any brightening of my skin tone, but Im already pretty pale without much redness right now.

My biggest knock, beyond the price, is that this doesnt contain sunscreen, something I think every day moisturizer should have. That protection alone is hugely anti-aging, in a very measurable way, and even in winter you should be using daily protection on your most delicate skin (face, neck and hands).

But after almost three weeks of use, day and night, I have not noticed any lightening of any dark spots/patches. I have very fair, fairly thin skin and the dark spots I have are not terribly dark to begin with so I thought they would lighten pretty quickly, but if there has been any change, it is so negligible that I don't see it.

So, for me the lightening aspect is not working, but I absolutely LOVE how my skin looks in every other way since I began using this.

Unlike so many other luxury brands that seem to be more jar than product, there is a lot of product in this jar.

The little spatula that is included is also very nice because it keeps fingers out of the jar and lessens the chances of contamination.

I believe that most skin enhancing results are gained through a healthy diet, sufficient sleep and limiting stress, accompanied by a simple cleansing routine that doesn't strip your natural pH, a gentle exfoliating strategy, and regular application of sun sunscreen. This was sent as a sample for reviewing purposes and I have been using it twice a day after my skin cleansing and toning routine. I might mention, in reviewing another topical product, a similarly priced toner, some months ago, I came to the conclusion that it was a very good product, but just obscenely priced for what it accomplished and gave it a correspondingly medium rating. Normally, skin seems to need to acclimate to a new product and then it takes weeks if not months to see any results, since it's the skin that repairs itself. A product only usually assists in removing the top dead skin cells and offering some rehydration to keep the cells protected and plump. That being said, after barely 2 weeks, I see  a noticeable difference in my skin, It seems more even and balanced and subtly youthful. Enough so, that I decided to write this review now instead of waiting 5 or 6 weeks as I imagined would be necessary. I can't see how much its being depleted, but if it lasts anywhere near the 8 weeks it says it might last, I will purchase it again.

I don't have particularly dry skin around the eyes, so it's not like I am just expecting too much from the cream. It just simply is not moisturizing and actually makes the skin feel more dry as the day goes on. So if you want or need something moisturizing, stop right here and look at another one.

What I do like about it is that it does make the area under and around my eyes look and feel smoother. I can put a moisturizer on top if it and it won't pill up or roll off in little particles. I typically apply this first, wait about 20 min or so and then apply my face moisturizer and I just spread it into my eye area as well so I get that moisture. If I don't do that, later in the day I can tell the area is dry. More dry than before I used the eye cream.

Make up applies perfectly fine on top of it both on the eyelid and under the eye.

It doesn't have a greasy or employment feel at all. It absorbs well and you don't feel any residue. It us a light cream, more textured like a creme serum.

I don't have any other complaints about it other than the lack of moisture and that it seems to make the area more dry than it started. I would say the skin around my eyes is normal.. not oily, not dry or tight and not very crepe-y at all.

I normally really like strivectin products and they're a brand that the products ttpically do what they say. I was let down with this one since it claims to be moisturizing.

I mean, I don't mind spending on lovely shoes or clothes if you get things like leather soles, fine details on seams, etc. Cosmetics can be tricky. I often do choose more costly makeup if the quality of it is superior to drug store brands (but lately the cheaper brands have been indeed upping their game!) They just apply more easily and last so much longer with less product than the cheaper stuff. I still will try anything, but won't rebuy unless it deserves it!

Lotions have never thrilled me. I mean they are fine and feel nice, but one rarely seemed to outperform another. So I just keep trying different ones thinking that ""maybe someday I will find the one."" I have tried things from La Mer all the way down to plain old petroleum jelly. Then, I usually feel stupid for spending what I did when I don't love the item.

Anyway, I didn't have any expectations that this was going to be any better than anything else. I must say though, that I was very surprised at how much I like this! It is a thick consistency. That quality is nice in a more expensive cream as you don't need as much product. I use less than a pea size for my whole face and neck, just tapping it in. It does not have a greasy consistency at all, you don't feel any sort of film on your skin with this. That is especially nice if you put it on before make up. I had something recently that would sort of peel off like bits of glue when my primer or foundation hit it. I retired that stuff for use on my hands and legs (yeah, I am still too cheap to pitch it! ha ha!!)

It isn't a big jar, and it the actual container is a smaller pot molded inside a larger jar, so look at the actual amount. 1.7 ounces. I would guess that the area of the cream is about the size 2 stacked oreos (sorry for the weird reference!) although the outside jar seems bigger. Still, you need only a little. I just sort of glide my finger over it, not ""dip"" into it. I could see this lasting for a long time...3 months if I had to guess, but I use it sparingly 2 times a day.

So for what you actually use, it isn't super expensive. I kind of wish it came in a prettier jar, so I could just leave it out on my vanity, but it has lots of writing and stuff all over it. I will sometimes use a stick of some kind to dip into cream if it gets lower in the jar. I don't like wasting it by getting it under my fingernail. Even the opposite end of a thin makeup brush makes an easy applicator. I have tiny makeup spatula that I use to scrape the last bits of product out of jars. Even sephora sometimes has little sticks and things that you can keep after testing something in a store. Those McDonald stirrers are also nice!

I am not sure if any lotion is truly ""anti"" aging. I mean, it still is just cream. But I really love the way it makes my skin feel (especially under my no-longer-25-year-old eyes and neck) and the way it absorbs so nicely in my skin. I imagine different types of skin could feel differently, but it is wonderful on mine. If I do notice some miraculous turnaround in my skin, I will definitely update my review. For now though, the smoothness of my skin and the absorption is something that I do love and that will make me buy again.

I had some trouble finding out just what comprises NIA-114.  The StriVectin website touts more benefits but finally explains:  NIA-114 is a rebranded name for  Niacin/Vitamin B3.  The magic is in how that Niacin is delivered.  Niacin works by  stimulating repair of DNA, enhancing energy metabolism and skin cell turnover, promoting the release of leptin (a natural repair hormone) and stimulating a receptor that decreases hyperpigmentation.

So does it work?  It does a great job of moisturizing, diminishing fine lines and wrinkles (via a plumping mechanism), decreasing dullness and in my case, decreasing visibility of pores.  I had no negative reactions to the product, such as redness, itching, peeling, etc.  I have had these reactions from retinol derived products.

Sadly, almost all beauty products oversell their capabilities and play on our responses to watching our bodies age.  But this products does a fairly good job of meeting at least some of its stated claims.  I would recommend it as well as other complimentary products in this line.",1523836800,,"StriVectin Multi-Action Restorative Cream, 1.7 oz.",Luxury Beauty,$95.00,2018/04/16,0.010661504817983032

Hill,"Knowing nothing about chemistry I cannot vouch for the efficacy of the components of this cream but after a week of use my skin does look more hydrated and it feels soft. I live in a climate with temperature extremes made worse because there I little humidity.

These factors take a visible toll so regular use of face creams is an essential part of my routine. And although I don't expect aging to stop or retreat, I do need products I use to provide solid performance to protect my skin from what can feel like an environmental assault.

Directions are to use the thick cream in the morning and evening. So with a cotton swab I apply a bit more than a pea-size dollop to my face and an equivalent amount on my neck. Based on that usage after a week I estimate the 1.7 ounce jar should last four to six weeks but this will vary.

If something drastic happens I will definitely come back and update this review.  So far, it is a nice unscented cream.  The best part is that it soaks in nicely and doesn't sit on the surface feeling greasy.  I can apply this and then put on makeup just a few minutes later with no trouble.  My skin tends to be sensitive and this hasn't caused any breakouts or redness so far.  That is a big thumbs up.
The down side? It is far more expensive than the face cream I usually buy, and this company does that irritating thing where they give you a big heavy jar in an even bigger box...that has a deceptively small pocket of cream inside.  I imagine it really does contain the 1.7 ounces it says it does, but the jar is huge and heavy.  The box has an extra fold of cardboard to make it look even bigger.  My skin isn't particularly dry, but it does seem to take a lot to smooth over my face and neck.  Maybe I'm more dry than I thought? Or maybe this expensive cream takes a lot in each use?

928,1802,3,"06 30, 2018",A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B01CP39HMG,ChristineMM,"This is an overpriced skin cream which is highly fragranced. My jar arrived without any other packaging and there were no ingredients listed so I referenced the company's website for the data to figure out what this product is. This is a typical non-natural skin cream product. This is scented with a lab made fragrance, to me it smells like a crisp orange with a twist of something woody. It is labeled as cedarwood but I work often with cedarwood essential oil and have cedar wood objects in my home and to me this is nothing like cedar, but I like the fragrance. This is highly scented which I like but it's like a cloud of fragrance if you apply it to your body (versus just your hands). This is a water based skin cream which does not have extra ingredients that would cross this over to a medical spa type healing product. This is a basic skin creme. So this is overpriced for what it is, it is 220 ml which is 7-ish ounces, do the math for the price.

So how did it perform? On my hands it absorbed 100% and immediately which acted more like a lotion than a skin creme, but my bare hands are used for things like cooking, dishwashing, cleaning, doing ceramics, making art, so they need more moisture than this can provide. On the hands this left no barrier afterwards, it was all absorbed instantly, I need something more and usualy a CREME provides that. That is why I say this acts more like a LOTION. On my body it sunk it but left some on the surface as a barrier. Because this is more like a lotion and due to the size to price ratio I didn't feel this was worth the cost, especially since it's a regular creme not a medical - spa grade treatment product, rating 3 stars = It's Okay. Also it is so strong I worried it would bother other people in public, in the interview I attended and in my college class and I didn't want to be that intrusive with my body fragrance.",1530316800,,"Rituals Body Cream, 7.4 fl. oz",Luxury Beauty,$33.00,2018/06/30,0.003067957504331125

WHAT IS THIS LIKE?
This salt scrub is made with fine himalayan salt.  It comes in a red plastic jar and is sealed.  It has some oil in it, but mostly salt, so it is not over-oily.  The smell is delicious.  Although it has some artificial fragrance, it does not gag me or make me prefer a natural one instead.

HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?
When using this in the shower with dampened skin, I found that I only need a teaspoon for my arms and a little more than that for each leg.  The salt is very fine and it does scrub well.  It is not overly oily, but it does seal the skin nicely, creating a moisturizing effect.  The fragrance is very lovely.  It stays on long enough to make me feel special, but is not so strong that people recoil when they encounter me after a shower.

ANY BAD REACTIONS?
There have been no bad reactions to this at all.

MOISTURIZING?
The moisturizing lasts for me all day and into the next day although it is summer and I don't have as hard of a time as winter for dryness.

THE BOTTOM LINE
For a beautifully fragrant experience that feels royal and naturally but gently exfoliates the skin, this scrub is really lovely.  More natural in composition than some scrubs, it is a very rich experience.

MY RATING
I give this five stars.  I would purchase this again.  It would be even more luxurious in winter time when I love rich smelling natural leaning products.",1533427200,,"Rituals Body Scrub, 13.2 oz",Luxury Beauty,$29.00,2018/08/05,0.0035382272090601356
940,1814,4,"08 4, 2018",A1J5HIF41ENSMZ,B01CP39FL4,Adam Wood,"This review is for the Ayurveda variety.

I personally quite like the scent of the Ayurveda scrub as it does have a calming effect with me, and it seems to work well as a scrub.  I do need to dip into the jar to get salt about four or five times to cover my body, but that seems reasonable to me.

It would be nice if the salt stayed together a bit better as I was transferring it from the jar to my skin.  The salt doesn't really stick together that well, so it wants to fall off of my fingers.

Related to that - I took a star away because I also ordered a smaller jar of this same scrub, and the two jars have different consistencies.  This larger jar has more liquid in it (the oil mentioned in the description, I presume), whereas the smaller jar is more dry and seems more like compacted salt.  I only have the two jars to go by, so I'm not sure if other jars differ as much, too.  The salt in this one stays together better because there's more oil to bind it, but the grains are still kind of loosely held together.

It works really well to make my skin feel better, and the scent is soothing to me.  I ultimately really like the end effect, but I would like the scrub to be more consistent from jar to jar, as well as be easier to apply.",1533340800,,"Rituals Body Scrub, 13.2 oz",Luxury Beauty,$29.00,2018/08/04,0.0035382272090601356

It scratched my skin (not in a good exfoliating way but in a painful way) and the smell, which is weird, is lingering on my arms two hours later. For $29 (cost of this product), you could roll around in the sand at the beach (less painful), rinse off in the ocean (for the salt experience), pay for parking, and still have some money left for an ice cream---and it would be a lot more enjoyable.

Typical soaps rid the skin of oil and leave it with a tightness or astringency that might make one want to moisturize afterwards.  This scrub, however, leaves the skin feeling clean yet moisturized at the same time.  Admittedly, that characteristic took a bit of getting used to.  It's not objectionable, just different.

With regard to the fragrance--sweet orange and cedar wood--I couldn't say with certainty that it did or did not smell like what's on the label, but I did like the scent along with its potency.  A welcome change.

As with all salt scrubs the salt sinks to the bottom and the oils pool at the top so you have to stir it up with your fingers before use. The fragrance is eucalyptus, I could not detect any ginger. It is marketed to give the skin a warming feel from the ginger but I did not detect any warming sensation or ginger fragrance at all. This is a spa like experience you can do at home. The shower floor needs to be washed after as it leaves a layer of oil which is a slip and fall hazard for the next user of the shower.

The salt does a great job of exfoliating skin, and as it dissolved, made for a nice bath soak for my tired muscles too.  At first I thought the scrub was too dry but I am glad I resisted adding a bit of light sesame oil to it, because once I rinsed the salt off it left my skin just the right level of moisturized, super soft and silky without feeling too greasy.  The tub was easy to clean out afterwards, no heavy greasy film left behind.  I took off one star because I think the salt is a little too coarse but most importantly because it seemed to have an odd menthol feeling.

951,1825,5,"07 19, 2018",A2RQOO8VYAEZZG,B01CP39FL4,Cupcake,"As much as I hate when people use the word delicious to describe anything but foodthis scrub is delicious. I subscribed to an embarrassing number of beauty boxes for a couple of years, so Ive tried all manner of fancy, expensive body products, and Im usually underwhelmed. Scrubs in particular seldom impress, because they're so easy to make it home (salt or sugar base, oils, plus other additives like oatmeal etc.), but this one is amazing. Its so luxurios feeling and smelling, the experience is true decadence. The balance between the scrub and the oily vehicle is perfect, and it doesnt have that utilitarian feel of homemade and most commercial scrubs (Im not describing this well, but the bottom line is that it doesnt perform like something I could make myself with ingredients in my pantry and bathroom).

Though its a salt scrub, it didn't irritate the many scrapes and scratches on my legs, unusual for a salt scrub (and why I lean toward sugar scrubs). It left my skin soft and hydrated, but didn't leave me greasy or leave behind a slick coating in my shower.

But the really unique part of this scrub is the scent. Generally speaking, I wish every single product I use was unscented instead of scented the way it is. Rituals brand is one of the few consistent exceptions. Ive tried many of their scents through beauty boxes, and they're all very different and all very good. This one is rich and exotic but not overwhelming or cloying, just decadent.

Just as a sidenote, I hate all that marketing nonsese about purifying sea salt and this scrub purifying body and soul. Huh? My souls is pure now? Thats a neat trick. _ But its definitely a bath treat lavish enough to qualify as a little bit of sensory self-care.

Finally, this scrub stands up on its own.

Carpenter,"A bit pricey for something that gets used up a bit too fast, but cooling and soothing makes you feel really fresh after a shower.  I have used AXE and other body scrubs, and I like to use them after I exfoliate with a brush and a good soap.  Exfoliation is the best way to get clean in the bath or shower.  One of the things I learned on a scientific TV special years ago was that showering with hot or warm water actually encourages bacterial growth.  I was confused then how you'd keep from being eaten alive by microbes or why we all didn't stink to high heaven after a warm bath.  The answer is soap and other things that scrub away the skin which then carries the bacteria down the drain.  When I first use soap and get the basic grime off my skin when rubbed starts to ball up little bits to wash off.  A good body wash will cleanse that, even more and leave a good clean base behind.  It might even do you some good to run cool water when you're done to get the remaining bacteria to stop multiplying.

After a good soaping, and rinse this compound with some cooling and cleaning and other protective ingredients makes the skin feel fresh and alive. The scent is fantastic, but I question a bit the use of sugar in the compound.  Maybe it doesn't matter because pure sugar won't create bacterial growth, the question is will it in combination with skin cells give them something to eat, or is it inhibited by the other ingredients.  After a couple uses, I've noticed it lasts a long time even in the heat, so I don't suspect the sugar does much to make it bad.  On the Happy Buddha, it the jar talks of his smiling journeys and people rubbing his big tummy for luck.  I had an interesting experience taking a Japanese Saturday school class.  At the presentation event where each class does various plays, readings, singing or other presentations, they hold a lunch afterwards with lots of Japanese food from the parents and from patron businesses.  I was sitting there eating some sort of curry dish when a little kid came up to me, looked me right in the eye and rubbed my stomach (which is somewhat large).  I wondered what the heck was going on till one of the instructors said it's good luck in Japan to rub the bellies of Sumo Wrestlers.  I think that's an offshoot of the Happy Buddha maybe as the body shapes are similar.

That's what this fragrance is like. It's a bit strong so if you don't like strong fragrances you're not going to like this. On the other hand, if you like stronger, uplifting fragrances this is perfect. It almost smells as if it has a hint of cinnamon and other spices and an apple undertone. That's just me. Any fragrance you use on your hair or body is going to interact with your own chemistry and you'll either love the smell or hate it. In my opinion, this is a great scent for those frumpy, tired days when you need an uplifting fragrance to enhance your mood and make you smell good. I especially like it after being around someone who has been smoking or other odors that tend to stick to your hair, clothes, and skin. This takes care of the lingering odor right away.

I really liked the scent and found it instantly soothing.  I tend to like scents that are similar to 'musk', jasmine or utilize sandalwood as a general preference.

My daughter didn't like this scent at all.  She likes scents like cherry blossom, eucalyptus, and patchouli. **I give you this info in hopes that it can help you decide if this scent is for you.

Being water-based, this scent dissipates quickly and needs to be reapplied throughout the day to maintain its aroma.  If applied to freshly washed, moisturized skin, the scent stays a bit longer.

This body-hair mist added an instant lift to my mood when I sprayed it on.  I wish the scent lasted longer, but I do appreciate that it is oil-free and won't stain fabrics.

At a complete loss as to how to apply, I applied it as if it were something like a mud mask.  It is very easy to work with and went on silky smooth.  I went for kind of a ""medium"" coverage--not thick, not thin.  The product is creamy and soft and ""luscious"".

Does one let it dry like a clay mask.  Or only leave it on for a minute or so?  Who knows?  Considering that the product description says it can be used every day in one's morning ritual would imply that one would not have time to let it sit and dry.  But again, who knows?

I do know that the stuff is very tenacious!  Applying it as I did--letting it dry for 15 minutes or so, then rinsing it off--I can tell you that it seemed to take forever to rinse off.  Not only does one have to loosen the dried mask, this stuff creates lots of suds, so on has to rinse those off, too.  Well, it created quite the mess at my sink.....  I suggest that, if using as a mask and letting it dry completely, you should arrange to do it before hopping in the shower.  I think that is the most logical and effective and thorough way to remove this mask.

I've tried it as a cleanser, applying a bit to the brush head of my Soniclear (Michael Todd).  That worked well enough, as the cream is dense enough to stay on the brush head until one can get it up to the face.

There is hardly any fragrance.

Bottom line:  I'm not going to throw this tube away.

We tried leaving it on for 2 minutes and 5 minutes and 10 minutes and used it probably 5 times a piece over a two week period.

1038,1925,3,"05 18, 2018",A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B000AV4XW0,ChibiNeko,"One of the first things that irked me was that, as another person stated, there were no instructions on the box or bottle. While part of the instructions were pretty self explanatory like ""apply to face"", I also wanted to know how long I was supposed to keep the mask on as different masks are expected to remain on for different times. After some searching I found that this is supposed to remain on your face for 5-10 minutes.

This had some pros and cons to it. The pro is that it smells nice and applies easily enough, as it smears easily without having to rub it into your skin like some of the masks out there that are fairly dense. The con is that my face kind of broke out the day afterwards. My skin is a little funky sometimes - I can use almost anything but sometimes my skin just doesn't like certain things. It doesn't mean that the product is bad, just that for whatever reason the product and my skin aren't good matches.

You will absolutely want to use moisturizer with this afterwards since part of my skin was a little dried out and flaked up, but that wasn't something I found particularly bothersome since it was in an area that wasn't exfoliating as easily as other areas. Getting up a bit of dead skin that wasn't wanting to give up the ghost is actually fairly helpful, as I didn't want to over-scrub and cause more damage. It's not something I would use every day, as I have a face that's both oily and dry at the same time.

Now the question is whether or not it's worth the steep price tag. While it's nice and does work as directed I'm frustrated at the lack of directions and from it not agreeing with my skin. I just don't know if I can justify it over some of the things you can buy for far less. If I was going to splurge, I'd probably go for the Body Shop's tea tree oil clay mask or something from Clinique, both of which I've had good experiences with.",1526601600,,"Natura Bisse Stabilizing Cleansing Mask, 7.0 fl. oz.",Luxury Beauty,$54.00,2018/05/18,0.007386752973389243
1039,1926,3,"05 11, 2018",A5ZD6FBMZQGDS,B000AV4XW0,Lisa M,"The first thing that bothers me about this product is that it has no directions. I did receive a ""tester"" of it, as marked on the back and I assume that a ""final"" product would have a box and some directions.
Even though this is a ""cleansing mask"", you still should directions on its proper use. I also feel it should have some warnings, since it contains SALICYLIC ACID, such as:  DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE ALLERIGIC TO ASPIRIN. AFTER USING THIS , USE AN SUNBLOCK WHEN GOING INTO THE SUN AND AVOID DIRECT SUN EXPOSURE IMMEDIATELY AFTER USE. DISCONTINUE USE IF ANY EXCESSIVE REDNESS OR IRRITATION OCCURS. AVOID GETTING IN EYES OR MOUTH. DO NOT USE ON IMMEDIATE EYE AREA.
It does not even state what percentage of salicyilc acid is in it, which it should.

The product itself, is pretty similar to most clay masks and should be used one to two times a week, depending on the level of oiliness of your skin. It says it can be used as a cleanser, to remove makeup RESIDUE, but it really should not be used to remove makeup itself.
As a licensed esthetician, my recommendations on use are-

Apply to a clean, damp or dry face (that means remove makeup first. Apply an even, thin layer to face and neck, avoiding the immeadiate eye area. Leave on for approx. 5 to 10 minutes or until dry. (I found it to be quick drying, even drying on my hands, as I was applying it,) Rinse with warm water and/or a wet washcloth. Pat skin dry. Salicylic is drying and your skin will feel a little ""tight"" after use. I recommend applying something to the face , such as a moisturizing serum to rehydrate the skin. You may experience some redness that looks like a slight sunburn after use. The longer you leave it on, the more redness you will experience. If you feel a ""burning"" sensation during use, that means it has been on too long and you should wash off immediately.

Overall , the product works as it should if used properly. I would not use it as a daily cleanser, no matter how oily my skin was. It's too drying. These types of products are meant to deep clean your pores , to remove excess dirt and oil. Sometimes, you can experience breakouts after use. This is because the skin is being ""purged"" of impurities and is normal.

I have combination skin and did not experience any negative effects with use. I did have a slight redness after and had to apply a hydrating serum to my face.

Another thing I dislike about this is tha amount of parabens (preservatives) in it. It's quite a bit and I prefer products that are paraben-free, because they have been known to have negative effects on the body with prolonged use.

I like the way it works , but I think this product is a bit overpriced , considering you can get the same benefits from many less expensive alternatives, most that are paraben-free as well.",1525996800,2.0,"Natura Bisse Stabilizing Cleansing Mask, 7.0 fl. oz.",Luxury Beauty,$54.00,2018/05/11,0.0008834895171134933

I'm of the belief that great skin starts from the inside - eating well, proper nutrition, plenty of rest and hydration.
However, we are exposed to a lot of external factors:  environmental, makeup products that clog pores, humidity levels, etc.

This cleanser works by removing impurities and cleaning out pores.
After the first use, my skin felt soft and clean.
The big ingredients here is essentially what we call Aspirin:  Salicylic acid and willow bark extract.  They slough off dead skin and renew.  Rosemary, tea tree oil and aloe vera moisturize skin and condition it.

This formula works well for oily or acne prone skin as well as dry or combination skin.

My own experience with the product is that it can be a bit drying with daily use since it strips away oils.  I didn't have any reaction to it and consider it a way to get a clean-slate for applying beneficial moisturizers.

Natura Bisse, Diamond Extreme Anti-aging Bio-regenerative extreme cream isn't bad. It isn't super heavy (I would say light and super creamy), blends well and doesnt make your face look oily after applying your makeup. The scent is subtle/faint, not overwhelming at all. You only need a small amount. For example, I use a pea size amount on the four areas (cheeks, forehead and chin) on my face and blend. It works wonders on dry skin, especially around my nose which is usually irritated around allergy season. And on the weekend when I don't wear makeup, Natura Bisse gives my skin a healthy glow. It also blends in nicely on my neck.

Now to explain why I have deducted half a star. Well, it is pricey! The cost for an 1.7oz jar is $365 (I received a .5oz. container). Regardless, wow the retail price is astronomical.  For those who can afford high end moisturizes, this might be worth it, but for the average consumer like me, who doesnt note anything unique about this cream, that is a bit steep. What I can say is that I did not have any breakouts or redness following the use of this product, and I have very sensitive skin. In conclusion, I like this product, but keep in mind that I have only been using it for a short period of time so I am not sure of the long-term effects. I will revisit this review if necessary.

I think the scent is quite pleasant and although it's definitely noticeable, I don't find it particularly aggressive at all.  The cream itself is thick, rich and luxurious and keeps my skin hydrated all day long.  At the same time, it absorbs well, leaving no greasy residue.  Although Natura Bisse Diamond Extreme may be worn under makeup, I also sometimes like to wear it alone for a more natural effect.  If you spend time outside, you might consider adding a sun protection product to your regimen as that is conspicuously absent from the ingredient list.

The jar is made with a wide mouth so that you'll easily be able to access every last bit of product. I'd anticipate with once daily application to my face, the jar will last 2-3 months. The scent of the product is mild with a slight chemical tinge. It's not unpleasant, but neither does it lead me to go ""mmmmm"" when I open the jar.

A little doesn't go far so one has to use it up faster than I anticipated. The skin absorbs it real fast; you have to anticipate using it at a faster than normal rate for a facial cream. I've purchased many facial creams on Amazon and reviewed most of them. So I have a sense of absorption rates and this is the highest rate I've ever come across.

After using it, one feels their skin being smooth, almost scary smooth. And it makes the skin feel tight while being moisturized at the same time. That's an unusual effect.

While I'm saying this is remarkable, the included parabens are worrying. The FDA is still studying the effects of parabens in cosmetics.

Saying that, I was immediately surprised by how good this felt on my skin. Normally it takes a couple of weeks before I feel like I can review a product like this (unless it causes any irritation or a rash) but in this case, from day one it felt amazing.

I used this at night and as soon as I put it on, it made my skin feel silky. But heres the thing - the next day when I woke up my skin still felt just as silky and fully moisterized and I haven't yet had a product work as well as this. In fact just by using it at night my skin felt silky all day.

Ive now been using this for a few weeks and I think this will be the cream I will be using in the future. And I say that after having just been given  dozens of similar type products to review. I have drawers and shelves replete with anti-aging products and creams,  and this one just jumped to the head of the line.

I do have two things to say in critique - I don't like the smell of it, which really might be a big deal for some.  I prefer creams that have no odor or the ones that have that fresh spa smell. But  this one, for me at least,  had a bit of a perfume or artificial smell,

The other complaint, is that I thought a pea-sized amount would cover a larger area than it did. Now this may just be my issue - I have older skin - but I swear as soon as I put the smaller amount on my face and neck I could practically hear my skin sucking it up. As a result, I have to use more than Id like to cover my entire face and neck. Now, normally I don't comment on price because I don't believe that should effect a review of the product, but in this case I do because if you're like me and your skin really soaks this stuff up, you're probably going to have to be purchasing this more often than youd think.

With two issues like this I wouldnt usually give a product 5 stars, but how could I not give this one maximum stars just because its one of the best moisterizers creams Ive ever used.

Having used the small version, I can't tell if the larger one would provide better results over time. The price of the 1.7 oz version, however, is very high and for that same price you could get a Botox treatment, quite frankly.

It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel nice and smooth, but I honestly can't say it shaved twenty years off my skin. It feels very concentrated so you don't need a lot, which is a relief given how pricey it is.

I love it and it makes me happy but I have to do conditioning treatments every couple of weeks to keep it manageable and not feeling like straw. One of the reasons I highlight my hair, besides the gray, is because it's very thin and fine and when I highlighted it gives it some plumpness and body.

While I won't say this is a miracle product, I was actually hoping for it to be. It works fairly well and it does add a little bit of plumpness to the strands of my hair. I do notice a little volume as well but I'm also using this in addition to the PHYTO volumizing spray. I don't believe however, it adds much moisture to my hair as I still have to use a heavier conditioner to be able to brush through it easily.

It comes in a metal bottle with a flip top and you pour it into your hand. It's actually dark in color and reminds me of a thin maple syrup. It lathers incredibly well but does not smell particularly good. It's not horrible but there's a little medicinal feel to it.

I read reviews before trying this product that suggested spraying the product into your hand and applying this way to avoid any greasy build-up.

This product felt light in my hair, and it seemed to help it dry MORE quickly.

-

Vichy Purete Thermale 3-in-1 face wash is a  purifying milk facial wash, eye makeup remover, and toner. I don't really get the toner part, but I can clearly see the milk facial wash part.

I received a 3.3oz sized tube, which is sort of a travel size compared to the full 6.7 sized product. The value of the trial/travel size is about $9.50, while the regular size is  just under $20.

I love Vichy products, and find their items are reasonably priced so I can afford them in my tight budget.

Though this is for sensitive skin, I am getting a little bit of an itch to my skin from it. Something in it irritates my skin just a little. I do have sensitive skin. This does happen with products from time to time. Its not bad, but it is there so I have to put this in my review, and is the reason for 3 stars instead of 4, since it is supposed to be made for sensitive skin. Its the only negative to this product. Ive not had any problems with any other Vichy facial product, and as happens with some products, there will be that slight irritation and then it goes away.

The creamy consistency makes it really easy to smooth onto my face. You can wash it away with water or just swipe it awayI chose to wash it away. As some reviewers mentioned, it does feel as if it isn't quite washing all away, but I don't mind this, and in fact, I like the moisturizing feel of it. And afterwards, my skin feels so very very softI love that!  I put some on my hands and instead of washing it away, I just wiped my hands on a towel, and my hands were super softno residue is felt as I type this, just soft hands.

What I like about it, as well, is its thicker than the usually micellar waters Ive tried; more of a creamy consistency instead of a water consistency.

The Vichy product line has been around for about 80 years. They have a really nice website with an online magazine with information you can peruse on skin care and their products. Theres plenty of information there to learn about Vichy and its product line.

Vichy and LOreal are two of my regular go-to companies for skin care. Ive been pleased with the quality, results, and the reasonable price. The only negative to this 3-in-1 is that slight irritation to my skinvery slight but still there all the same. However, it feels so luxe on my skin, Ill likely use it unless I have more irritation from it with continued use.",1524096000,,"Vichy Puret Thermale One Step Cleanser for Sensitive Skin, 3.3 Fl.

1.  The Hold is supposed to be strong.  I don't see that.  Medium hold is a more accurate description.  The product doesn't hold well in humidity or when there's a little wind.  I wouldn't be bothered by that if it didn't say strong hold, but it does, and it's not strong.
2.  The consistency of the pomade.  It's a lot softer(maybe goopier)than other pomades I've used.  It feels more like a gel to me.  I'm not saying it's bad this way, just outside the norm of other brands.
3.  The scent:  It's nice.  Not over powering, but it's there.
4.  Ease of use:  Very good, It's a great pomade for someone just getting started using this type of product with short hair.
5.  The branding:  Very cool!

1139,2028,5,"04 5, 2018",A2GA64WZK8PKBC,B0010JREC2,Farm Chick,"So far I really like this cream, it's very light (doesn't feel occlusive) and penetrates well, both are points that are important to me. The fragrance is also light and dissipates fairly quickly. On my hands (which are very dry compared with the rest of my body) I need a bit more moisture but I'm holding off on applying any additional product(s) until I use this product awhile longer to see if that's necessary in the long run. I really appreciate the lightness of this product on the chest area where I tend to perspire readily.

The active ingredient in NIA products is niacin. Some reviewers have reported some side effects that I feel are related to reactions to niacin, which can be fairly common in people taking the supplement internally. Since it IS such an 'active' ingredient, I suggest some caution for people who tend to flush or overreact when taking niacin as a vitamin as well as people with hypersensitive skin in general. Try a test patch before applying generally over other areas of the body. This being said, my own skin is somewhat sensitive, especially since I use Retin A, various topical peeling agents, chemical peels, etc. to help with acne and other problems I have with my skin. I haven't had any reactions to the NIA 24 product and my skin has remained calm after application. I have tried niacin based serums in the past which have made my skin react negatively, so I'm pleased that this hasn't been the case with this particular line of products.

I love the way this cream is packaged, in a 'plain tube' vs more fancy types of packaging and there's a generous amount of product to work with. Typically, it takes longer to see results on the body compared with facial products so it's important to use this cream for a long enough period of time before judging the end results accurately. This is even more important for people over 40, the cells take a bit longer to turn over than younger skin. I plan on using this product as a companion to my dermarolling that I'm doing for both hyper & hypo pigmentation problems from previous sun damage and hope it will work well in evening out my pigmentation issues. It's really too soon to judge the effectiveness of this cream yet, but I do plan to update this review when enough time has passed for a fair perspective. However, if you are using any exfoliating products on the body (such as alpha or beta hydroxy products) you may see improvement sooner since those products will indeed boost the effectiveness of niacin.

I'm a retired paramedical esthetican and am looking at this product from a professional as well as personal point of view and can say that I would feel very comfortable recommending this product to my clients with sensitive (or 'sturdy') skin types that are seeking improvement for sun damage based upon my experience so far. I will be back to comment further after a month or so has gone by since at least a 30 day time period is required to see improvement with hyperpigmentation, old cells must be replaced with new and healthier cells and a 30 day window would be the minimum. Please note that Niacin is a melanin suppresive agent, it stops new melanin cells from forming but does not remove what's already there. This method 'starves' the skin of melanin over time, so you absolutely MUST give this product time to do it's work.

If you're looking for an instant result, look to laser or chemical peels, they are the only approach that will give a so called 'instant' result (which appears after a coresponding down time of peeling of the skin). It is actually the deep peeling which removes some of the surface melanin. A potent sunblock over treated skin is also a must, regardless of the weather and this applies to indoor lighting if you spent hours/days under fluorescent  lights (which give off low level UV) and can also contribute to pigmentation problems. Realize that people who have hyperpigmentation from either injury to the skin (scar tissue formation) or hormonal issues may need additional help to correct these problems. No topical product will be helpful for either, unfortunately, without dealing with the underlying cause. Injury to the skin must heal completely before topicals can do their work, and hormone imbalances must also be corrected internally for products like NIA to work effectively. With these caveats in mind, I feel this product has great potential to help common hyperpigmentation problems for both men and women of all ages without oversensitizing the skin as with acid based products.",1522886400,2.0,"Nia 24 Sun Damage Repair for D&eacute;colletage and Hands, 5 fl. oz.",Luxury Beauty,$60.00,2018/04/05,-0.021920248708528507

I order my makeup online from Nordstroms or Neiman so I can get all the freebie anti wrinkle skincare samples they include to try.
I have used them all from Chanel, Kiehls, on to the Walgreens or Wamart offerings such as Neutrogena, Ponds Oil of Olay, and of course the pyramid scheming sales of Mary Kay, Arbonne and other up and coming companies your friends are selling as you try to hide and ignore the sales pitches.
I can say very honestly this is a luxury product and feels amazing on my skin.  Gently softens and works out the fine lines near my eyes.  A light sheen when first applied it seems to hold without stretch or drying, just floats on in a light white cream.  Silky smooth and my makeup goes on wonderfully after applied.  No splotches of buildup. Does NOT fade away, your skin feels protected.  You can come back and rinse your face after wearing for hours and you can feel the glide of the product still there, still protecting.  But not heavy you don't feel smothered either.

It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely.

The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps.

With the eyeliner pencil, I've been majorly disappointed. Why?
- The pigment is on the lower side
- One needs to apply the pencil really hard to get some color on the eye

When worn, I found it to fade after several hours. It took nothing but a quick redo to refreshen the look I desired to have. I feel this is best worn when it's dryer out and not when it's rainy all the time since this is not water-proof.

I had zero discomfort or dryness to my eyes after wearing for a long time. It has no smell that I can detect.

I like how easy it is to apply. The only issue I ran into was when I first received it and the huge pain it was to remove the packaging on the lid. Once this packing is removed the plastic top is easy off and on but not so easy that it will just come off if tossed in a makeup bag or purse.

I had ""heard"" of SkinMedica and seen the products at our Dermatologist's office. Promoted by Oprah and featured in Allure Magazine.  However, my knowledge was very limited. So I began reading all the ""information"" I could find. (Which everyone should do before using any kind of ""fountain of youth product."") I was a bit taken-a-back by the idea of using 'foreskin' on my face. The IDEA was jarring, the facts not so much. Yes they start with foreskin in the lab and 1 foreskin can be used in the fibroblast procedure for years!
So after the initial shock, I had to be totally, unapologetically honest and admit I would use almost any ingredient that could deliver a refreshed, more youthful look.

Upon Arrival: As pictured, it arrives in a black slip box. Removing the box reveals the 1.0 ounce, single touch, dual dispense, product bottle with chrome colored cap, lightly attached to the base of the box. (Simply wiggle the bottle slightly to remove it from the box bottom.)

I have used this product exclusively for 31 days. (The day I placed the order to try the TNS Essential Serum I stopped my daily regiment of Nerium products. This gave me 5 days in between.) Before engaging the pump the first time, I lightly tapped the bottom of the bottle on the counter three times. Holding it firmly and making sure to tap the bottle evenly. (As this was suggested  by my clinician, as well as, many websites.) I have NOT had any problem with the use or function of the bottle.

You can see from the pictures - with a single press of the button there are two products simultaneously released. . . One, off-white and lotiony-like. The second is crimson colored and gel-like. I dispensed one ""pump"" onto the back of my hand, mixed with my finger, and applied to my face, forehead, nose, and around my mouth. Then a second pump for my jawline, neck, and decolletage.
It feels incredibly silky while applying. When I touched my face As it was drying, it felt sticky-ish. It takes up to 7 seconds to fully dry. Then lightly touching/sweeping my face it feels soft, almost creamy-ish. That's a really nice feeling! There is an odor  - that I can best describe as slightly medicinal. It doesn't last long and definitely would not prevent me from using the product.

I am 47-years-old, was a sun lover, have two forehead frown lines, laugh/smile lines, and the dreaded ""tired"" or ""hollowed"" under eye issue. (Thankfully I haven't battled acne in many years.) Unfortunately I was NOT impressed with the TNS Serum. NO, I did NOT expect a face transformation. But at 238$ an ounce and all the hype I did expect something more than the creamy feeling after application. I do think my liquid make-up looked smoother, which I really liked. But I can get the same result from a good face primer. (And it's a lot cheaper.) Maybe you have to use this with other SkinMedia products or maybe results take more than one bottle to get. (I had Visable, Noticeable results with my regular regiment the first week.)

Like all skin revitalize, rejuvenate products individual results vary. This may be a miracle cream for some - It was simply so-so for me.

I was unfamiliar with the benefits of Niacin topically for skin, but did find that Niacin (vitamin B3) helps heal wounds, repair sun damage and hyperpigmentation, and strengthen the skin barrier, making skin better able to retain moisture. Niacin is a water-soluble vitamin, which means it is unable to deeply penetrate the fatty layers of the skin on its own. Therefore, it is essential to use a fat-soluble, or lipophilic, form of the vitamin.

1318,2223,4,"04 20, 2018",A194K60CWZ371J,B008XWXZ9U,Elly,"The Sultra The Bombshell Rod Curling Iron I really like. I am able to quickly and easily achieve the styles for my hair that I was hoping to get from a styling tool such as this.

For the higher price tag, I assumed this would have a few more features like beeping when I've held a curl long enough ( 8 seconds per instructions) or an option to adjust the heat but it doesn't.  Because it doesn't have these features, I am taking a a star off just because I feel for the price these important and somewhat expected features should have been implemented.

The features this curling iron does have is that it heats up very quickly, there's a 9-foot no-tangle swivel cord, an auto-shut off safety feature, and it's light-weight. Included is a styling glove and an iron pad to rest the iron on when needing to place it down while styling your hair.
My hair is very long. It's thick and normally quite wavy. That being said, I do have to spend some time on my hair for certain styles. I typically use this iron to achieve a few ringlets here and there but not all over. The results come out great when paired with heat protection sprays applied first.
The Curling iron is easy to use. There is one power switch which goes up and down i.e off and on. I haven't accidentally bumped it off when styling.  Since there is no adjustable heat settings, there's nothing else to fiddle with. You simply wait about a minute and the iron is ready to use. When styling it's important to use the glove so you don't accidentally burn yourself. When wrapping and getting to the last bit of that hair to curl my fingers get pretty close to the heating unit so I am glad the glove is included.
The amount of time needed for each curl to set will fully depend on how much hair your grab at once. If it's a smaller, thinner amount I would suggest 8 seconds but it's a thicker amount 15 seconds may be better. There will be trial and error to find what best works so a learning curve is necessary.

I can style my hair with this tool and results can last for a couple of days. I am quite pleased with the look I get and how no-brainer this tool is to use. I didn't get any weird bumps or things like others have mentioned in their reviews. I am including pictures of my waves and ringlets with my post so you can see the results I got.

There is a two-year warranty on this product which is great for the money you'll be shelling out on it. I feel the price is reasonable for the high-quality hair styling you can achieve.

I decided to try this hydrating one to see if I could skip a step or two (my moisturizing and age defying steps) in my morning routine.  I like my current foundation by La Roche-Posay better than this one.  I wish companies would keep the same color names across foundations, It would be so much easier to try multiple formulas.  I tried the 2 lightest colors-Light Beige and Ivory.  I'm very white, but the Ivory is ridiculously light.  When my husband saw me he said ""boo.""  I said ""what is that for?""  ""You look like a ghost,"" he replied.  The light beige was a better match to my skin tone, but still lighter than the other La Roche-Posay foundation.  This foundation is thicker than the BB Blur mouse.  It can be hard to apply, especially in the summertime.  I tried spreading it with my fingers and a foundation brush.  The brush spread better than my fingers, but left streaks, so I have to do a little of both to get the best coverage.  I took off 1 star for the coverage- being hard to put on.  Powder helps set the foundation, so I only need to apply once a day.  It looks better with powder.  I was concerned the moisturizer might make me break out, but did not.

Apart from the charging dilemma, I can feel the difference on my skin. Foreo leaves my skin super soft and smooth, especially after I rinse the cleaner off my face, dry and apply moisturizer with the Foreo. Though its not as delectable as a professional facial, it feels gentle and nurturing on my face, and I certainly feel proactive trying to combat the aging process!

It makes the skin around my eyes feels firmer, smoother and softer. Im in my 50s but don't yet have crows feet, puffiness or bags, so I cant say if this eye cream helps those concerns. I do have fine lines that I think looked better while using Strivectin Intensive Eye Concentrate, but I didn't notice improvement with Strivectin AR.

Its lightweight and didn't cause issues with my makeup application.

I used Strivectin AR about 10 days but stopped as my dark circles were more noticeable, and I was concerned by a high risk 9 rating on the EWG site. Among other things, this cream has BHA, BHT and retinol. While retinol can produce positive results with time, the risks (including cancer) concern me. I wasn't really aware of the controversy and possible risks until after I started using Strivectin AR, and I decided I don't see enough improvement to continue use at this time (but don't know how long it takes to achieve optimal benefits).

I would take 10 minutes every afternoon before my husband got home to pat on some of this powder to make myself a little more presentable after wrangling babies all day. Please keep in mind - I say powder because it is a powder, but it's a powder foundation. You can use it on its own, but in order to prevent transferring or break down, you need a good setting spray applied over this. I have applied it by itself, but as a result I've experienced transferring when I did so. Another benefit of powder foundation is that you are much less likely to see product pilling, which is when your product balls up on your skin. This often happens when you're applying more than one layer without letting it absorb thoroughly or if you're applying too large an amount.

Coverage is great, and you can easily build to a full even application. This applies with a round sponge pad, and there's a pretty good amount in the pan. Dermablend is a professional brand, and for good reason. It's pretty high quality makeup - I believe I first came across it years ago in a tattoo magazine article or letters section for a future bride who needed to cover a tattoo on her wedding day. It's good stuff, and I like that at this point in time, it's possible for the average consumer to get products like this without being a professional or having a connection.",1529280000,,Dermablend Intense Powder High Coverage Foundation,Luxury Beauty,$34.00,2018/06/18,-0.004023402253267265

I've used and loved both the liquids like Flawless Creator and the solids like Cover Creme, but nothing from Dermablend or any other company has ever covered messed-up spots as fast or as flawlessly as this powder. When I have a horrible zit or a red, rough patch or anything else that is not only discolored but has a different texture from the rest of my face, this is what I reach for. I put just a bit on one corner of the included sponge and just dab it on the spot and it's GONE. And it's totally opaque, and best of all it's matte and because it's powder it doesn't settle into grooves or accentuate rough skin; it just sits on top and conceals everything. The first time I used it I was in such bad shape and I had to go to a client meeting, and when I tried this I nearly cried with relief. I hope you're never so desperate, but if you are, may you know the reassurance of having this on hand.

Here's a tip to make sure that this is really invisible on your skin: If you don't know your Dermablend color, order a free sample kit from Dermablend's site before you order.

Besides obviously limiting my overall sun exposure, my dermatologist recommended that when I do go out in the sun to use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and one that is broad spectrum (protects against both UVA and UVB rays).

In every way, the beautiful packaging, sleek and modern looking bottle and amazingly micro-mist type pump action from the dispenser for this Jimmy Choo Man are straight 5s for presentation and utility. The heavy weight and leatherette banding of the top cap is also a nice touch, as is the metal accent shoulders. I love the way this bottle looks, feels and pumps.  That said, I am not a big fan of the scent, and neither is my husband, who I sprayed this on.

The scent from the bottle is at first quite pleasant, with a sharper woodsy note at the front and reminds me of how some higher end hotel toiletries are scented. Over time, however, the under-notes are more reminiscent of how women's magazines smell when they have a lot of scratch and sniff perfume scents in them- the blend is not unpleasant, but more feminine and generic. The smell on my husband starts to blend w his chemistry to become somewhat ""powdery""  vs. crisp, and takes on a stronger mono-scent that's just smells like a boring perfume over time, which is really unfortunate.

I love the roller application, the serum absorbs more quickly, and Im not wasting product I will just wash off my hands. It is just as effective as the original neck cream.

Both the serum and the cream are not miracle workers. If you already have a sagging turkey neck it will not make that go away. It will make your skin appear smoother and firmer though, not so jiggly. It excels at diminishing the fine lines and tree rings that develop with age.

I am a value oriented shopper, and I don't take lightly the investment I make in the Strivectin products I use. They are very effective and concentrated, so I don't need to use much.

You can't normally say that cosmetic products. I've found most creams feel good going on, but don't do a heck of a lot. The StriVectin brand actually produces results. Granted, these results are minor, but they are quantifiable. I've tried some other StriVectin products -- also to good effect.

My wife recently lost some weight, and the skin of her neck developed some fine lines. After using the StriVectin Tightening Neck Serum Roller, the lines have visibly lessened. Her neck skin seems smoother and plumper, and the lines/wrinkles are no longer quite so apparent. It does not get rid of them completely and deeper lines are still there, but they too seem to be diminished.

To use, pop off the top and turn the roller head 180 to ON. The serum will then flow when rolling. The scent of this neck serum is pleasant and very mild, and the roller applicator feels good when applied. I've found that getting initial coverage and then turning off the feed and just using the roller to smooth things in, is the best way to spread the serum around without overdoing it. It causes no irritation and soaks into the skin quickly.

The fact that there are noticeable results when using the StriVectin Tightening Neck Serum Roller is more than enough for me to recommend it. I wish it didn't command a premium price, but you pay for what you get.

One thing I don't like about this pricey emulsion is the numerous ingredients.  I count about 36 or so.  First ingredient is water, of course, as is usual for many skin products, and there are also many innocuous and even good ingredients, such as those that are fruit derived and also niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, for example.

However, I'm not all that happy to find titanium dioxide, even if it is the last ingredient in the listing.  Also sodium hydroxide, which is also known as lye or caustic acid, can be a skin irritant and is never a favorite of mine.  And there's mica, which, although not usually a skin irritant, has its dark side because of the use of child labor in its mining in much of the world.

Granted, I imagine that none of these ingredients in the amounts of the formulation of the lotion will be harmful.  This seems to be a reputable company and most probably follows health and safety guidelines.  So I'm mainly rating this product based on bang for buck.

In that respect, I say it's just okay.  I haven't noticed any lessening of dark spots and that's supposed to be a main attraction of using this emulsion.  I will say that it does make my skin feel soft and smooth. But I can get the same result with less expensive products.

1498,2432,4,"08 5, 2018",A1VS1LL905P5L5,B00QPNKVGY,Hyytekk,"I'm always apprehensive when it comes to using and reviewing an expensive serum or face cream. Why? Because we all have a strange willingness to part with our hard earned money for some small exotic vial of fluid if it purports to make our skin more youthful and radiant. The magic allure seems to rise exponentially the more expensive the product is. I've heard of the Erno Laszio line of products but this was my first opportunity to use a skin emulsion first hand. While not a chemist or scientist, my first response is to consult the ingredients list to try to make some sense of exactly what's in there and the product's strategy to produce it's desired end. Often there's some type of exfoliating acid that's designed to help loosen and gently dislodge the outer layer of dead skin cells and I've had great success with several of those products, though this emulsion seems to use another strategy. With the help of Google, I surveyed the ingredients in this emulsion with some interesting results. There were numerous ingredients whose purpose is to make the product glide on evenly and smoothly as well as fill tiny superficial imperfections with substances such as silicone derivatives. But if my admittedly pedestrian understanding is correct, the two seemingly active ingredients designed to do the heavy lifting are basically rice starch and niacinimide. (Not to ignore the oleanolic acid which is found in olive leaves and supports among other things skin elasticity, but it is listed almost last in the list meaning it is one of the least abundant ingredients in the formulation)  First, do some homework regarding rice water and rice based skin benefits and you might be surprised at the effectiveness of this simple easily purchased and even more easily made at home ingredient. In the past I liked very much Dermalogica's Daily Microfoliant product and a little probing revealed it was largely rice based also. As an alternative, I experimented by purchasing, believe it or not, white rice flour on Amazon. A generous 24 oz size is only 14 dollars. I used it exactly as I used the Dermalogica Microexfoliant and it seemed to produce the same positive results. You use it with water to gently exfoliate and then allow it to dry on your face before rinsing off. It is highly effective in brightening your skin and evening skin tone, though don't expect dramatic results overnight. But with consistent use it is impressively effective. I may have seemed to stray off point, since I can report that using this Lazio Emulsion produced gradual skin tone evening and I noticed a definite improvement as well. Forgive the meandering discussion, but I wanted to give an alternative to purchasing such a spendy product. Rice water or rice flour isn't nearly as sexy as a high end cream, but it seems to get similar results with a basic ingredient.

Niacinamide is also known as vitamin B3. I won't create an unreadably long lecture on that ingredient though I encourage you to do some homework yourself online. It also offers impressive results and should be included in any skin care routine. Interestingly, it is readily available in products costing a relatively meager fifteen to twenty dollars.

My evaluation, therefore, is that this Erno Lazio is an excellent and effective product you should not be disappointed in purchasing and using regularly. There is the matter of it's high cost which for  many might make it a deal breaker. You can have similar results, though, I believe from my personal experimenting and first hand observation, by purchasing a Niacinamide serum and making or purchasing Rice water or even rice flower and using it as a gentle daily exfoliant and mask all at a small fraction of the cost. Conversely, if your budget allows, and your not interested in experimenting, this Erno Lazio Radiende Emulsion offers a simple solution and an effective recommended product.

It has a whole list of ingredients and many of them seem to be plant based but it's still fairly granular and harsh on my skin and made it red and itchy in parts that are not oily. The menthol-like ingredient in it almost burned off my skin as it seemed too harsh. My eyes always get red and itchy with shampoos that have tea tree oil or peppermint for cooling the scalp, so I washed it off as soon as I realized it had some menthol type ingredient in it. However, it did help with an acne spot when I applied to the oily part near my nose that had a zit.

I cannot use this product as I am allergic to something in it, but I am giving it 3 stars as it seems to have a lot of natural ingredients and might work well for acne for some people.

However, if thats all it has, it won't be enough. Your sunscreen also needs to protect skin from infrared-A (aka IRA) rays as well, and heres why. Besides the sun, these rays can also come from less-obvious places. When you blow-dry your hair, or even get a gel manicure, your skin is exposed to them. IRA rays travel even deeper into skin than UVA and UVB rays, causing free radicals that further accelerate skin aging. What you're left with are fine lines and wrinkles no matter how much sunscreen you're putting on.  With all that said, we now understand why we need sunscreen. Sunscreen is now the new skincare standard.  We must use sunscreen to fight aging.  In paricular, we must use a sunscreen with infrared protection.  I have been using Goop sunscreen in SPF 40 and find it amazing.  It is clear, weightless, scentless and oil free.  I have never had a breakout using it.  It always goes on smooth and I never have to worry about my foundation applied on top, balling or pilling or just making a general mess of my face.  With the Skinmedica, I had the same results.  It however is not clear, nor scentless and I did have a few break outs when first using it.  The price of the Skinmedica is $57.80.  The price of the Goop is $28.00.

I am nearing 30, have combination skin, and the beginnings of fine lines under my eyes and around my mouth. I used this product AM and PM diligently for two months prior to this review.

Pros:
- Convenient, small packaging. This is easy to toss in your overnight bag and the cap makes it impossible for leaks to happen.
- No odor. It's nice not to be overwhelmed with florals when applying skincare.
- Moisturizing and slightly plumping. When wearing on my trouble spots (under eyes and marionette lines), there is a slight improvement after applying makeup on top of the filler. Is this significantly better than a drugstore moisturizer? Hard to say.

Cons:
- A single pump will give you much more than you need (unless you want to slather your whole face). This is a downside when the price point is so high.
- There is a weird residue/film. Whether I'm using in the morning and covering with makeup, or wearing at night alone, there is always a layer of this lotion that become slimy when it reacts to water. It makes me wonder if it's really soaking into my skin and treating anything, or just filling in the lines like a pore-filler would. Either way, it seems to sit on top of the skin and never soak in.
- No long-term benefit. The improvement really seemed to be temporary as in, I could only tell a slight improvement when I was wearing it under makeup.",1529971200,,"StriVectin High-Potency Wrinkle Filler Lotion, 0.5 oz.",Luxury Beauty,$59.00,2018/06/26,-0.008604355207870317

In contrast, I'm pretty sure this has had a very mild but enduring effect on my crow's feet.

I used the entire bottle, which lasted about 5 weeks, one pump twice daily. I applied first to my eyes, then spread the remainder to the rest of my face. As directed, after it dried, I followed with my usual moisturizer (in this case, a Revitalift product that I'd used independently and knew was having no real anti-aging benefits, but is an effective moisturizer). After about 3 weeks, I started to think I might be seeing an effect, and by the end of the bottle, I hadn't talked myself out of it. I know that's not a ringing endorsement, but compared to my typical impressions of so-called anti-aging products, it's significant.

It's easy to apply (tiny pump bottle--I always feel like I'm being cheated out of a couple applications with a pump, though it protects the product from contamination), absorbs and dries quickly. I would apply it, brush my teeth, and it would always be completely dry and ready for moisturizer.

I have one mirror with natural light that is particularly unflattering and always makes me feel like a crone when I catch my reflection. After the full bottle, I look marginally less ancient. Considering that's just 5-6 weeks, not too shabby. But considering it's $59 and a tiny bottle, and would cost me north of $500 a year to use continuously, unfortunately too much for me to extend my experiment.

My info: 47 with pretty good skin and average crow's feet and expression lines. Not prone to breakouts. Very dry skin in winter, dry enough to need moisturizer twice daily year round. My skincare routine is washing with plain water + moisturizer AM & PM, sunscreen if I will be outside at all, including longer drives.

Unlike a lot of these types of products that either temporarily fill in wrinkles, or combat lines and wrinkles over time as a treatment, this product claims to do both. The company does tout themself mainly as a wrinkle filler, however. As per the instructions I applied a small amount morning and night. A little goes a long way, and the packaging gives an illustration of just how little you need to use. I have horizontal forehead lines that are not normally overly obvious, so I applied this cream to those for a few weeks. The first thing I observed was a tightening of the skin, as if the product was trying to ""smooth"" out my fine lines. It reminds me of having like a dried glaze on your skin, not enough to notice while making facial expressions, but you can feel it when you run your fingers over it. I also discovered it was hard to put my foundation over that stiffness. My lines looked slightly filled in immediately, and the effect is magnified if you apply moisturizer over it.

The glass jar container is attractive and luxurious looking. The face cream itself feels wonderful on my skin. The skin brightening is not something that happens over night. I've been using this for a few weeks and my skin is just starting to show the effects of it.

With that said, this product is an investment. Not at all cheap, you'll need to keep up with it and reorder more when you get to the end of your jar.

And there's the potential for accelerated oxidation in jar packaging, although in the case of this cream most of the ingredients are quite stable and less prone to oxidation.

The ingredients are primarily moisturizers with the addition of niacinamide, salicylic acid, and a number of other innovative ingredients that have been shown to produce excellent benefits for the skin. I use the cream both morning and evening. I like to use it under my makeup because it doesn't pill up and destroy the finish of my foundation. I like it at night because it dries fairly non-sticky and fairly ""dry"" and doesn't transfer to my pillow like some oilier moisturizers do.

I only need a small amount, so this tube will likely last me a few months. Ive used Strivectin about 10 days and generally like it.

Ive had no sensitivity issues and my eyes don't sting, but Im careful not to apply it close to my eyes or on my eyelids. It absorbs well and leaves no sticky or greasy residue and doesnt interfere with my makeup. The fragrance is a little odd to me but mild. I always question the need to put fragrance in an eye product given that its just another possible irritant.

Im in my mid 50s and dark circles are a far bigger issue for me than the fine lines around my eyes. I don't have crows feet, sagging, bags or puffiness, so I cant judge how this works on those issues. I do think my fine lines around my eyes look hardly noticeable when using this cream, and my eye area seems to look slightly more refreshed. But the change isn't what Id call dramatic.

As I expected, I still have dark circles that Ive been plagued with since being a teen. At least they don't look worse when using Strivectin- which is what usually happens when I stop using my regular dark circle serum to try something new. That suggests to me that this might be as good or almost as good as my favorite dark circle serum. Still, my best friend for undereye circles is still my eye concealer by Amazing Cosmetics.

This Strivectin formula has niacin or B3 which is indeed supposed to be good. It also has plenty of chemicals that Im not qualified to judge. I did spot check many on EWG and most were rated low to moderately low risk, but I personally find BHT and Benzoyl Alcohol worrisome from what Ive read. Overall, however, I like this Strivectin eye cream pretty well and will keep using it to see about longer term results. 4 stars.

It doesn't take much product when just using around the eye area so this small tube lasts quite a while. It is quite expensive for my budget so I doubt that I'll repurchase it unless I'm more impressed as I continue to use it.

I have always tried to avoid things like glycolic peels, retinol creams etc because I feared a terrible reaction.  Over the last couple of years I have experimented with them because they are SO good at rejuvenating old skin which is really important.  I've had some terrible reactions with some products but they were cheaper and had ingredients that probably didn't need to be in there.  So onto the review for this.

After I washed my face I put a very small dot of product on my finger and rubbed it on my forehead first.  I figured if I was going to have a reaction, let's start there.  At first it had a slight tingle and then a burning sensation.  Not a bad burning sensation at all just a very very slight sensation.  At first I thought I should wash it off, but I've had this with other products and it goes away if I give it a minute.  It went away.  I waited 2 hours to ensure there was no reaction so that I could apply to the rest of my face, which I did.  Same tingling/burning sensation that went away.  I went to bed, woke up the next morning, washed my face, applied cream and within just ONE NIGHT my face had noticeable improvement in tightness, color & glow.  I've continued using it every other day and It works beautifully!

I could deduct a star for price, but I figured the review is about product alone and I had such good results I have to give the product itself 5 stars.  It is amazing.  The fact that I can actually take care of my skin without worrying about a major flare up is worth its weight in gold to me.

I liked the idea of an overnight C product, and since DCL has a good reputation and is cruelty-free, I thought I would try the C-Scape. I have been using it for the last three weeks.

I have not experienced the grittiness, stickiness, or stinging reported by others. To me, it's more like applying a thick and inert paste, kind of like embalming cream but less stinky. In fact, there's very little fragrance, and definitely not the signature C smell that I associate with C products. Maybe that's due to the formulation, which is supposed to ensure a gradual release of ingredients throughout the night. But I know that C degrades quickly, and I'm wondering whether this has any effective C content at all.

I like the dispenser and the pump has worked perfectly from day one.  It always amazes me when companies ask a high price but then expect customers to struggle with a finicky dispenser, like the last night-time product I've used. Don't cheap out!

The main thing about the product for me is how noticeably softer and livelier my skin looks since I started using it. I'd used Vitamin C-based products before and thought they'd worked well but then got sidetracked by newer products, so I was happy to try a new C-based formula.

I am very impressed with this product otherwise. When my skin is soft and supple the next morning, I know the treatment is a winner.  The texture of the skin, after removing the residue in the morning, is quite nice, I'll have to say.  I also see that a large percentage of this formula is Vitamin C, and I already know of the effects, which are healthy antioxidants, and youth-promoting properties, so I am sold on that. 30% Vitamin C!  Not rocket science to see the value here.  This has a pleasant smell.  I had a bit of trouble with the pump at first, but this is to be expected in the beginning.  Ever since, this has been fine.

I am a big fan of night regimens.  I wash my face with a creamy, NON-foaming wash, then I rinse, and apply my favorite product.  Then I make sure I am dry before I apply just enough to my dryer areas especially.

I have oscillated back and forth between products lately.  All of the products I have are of good integrity, so it is difficult to say which one I like best.  All of them have a tacky feel, which pleases me due to my mask that I have to wear at night.  Slippery, oily products simply make my mask go sliding, or they rub off onto my pillow.  I feel my skin every morning to see if the moisture is in tact, so I am happy to report that my requirements are filled here.

I am very pleased to report that I will not just keep this in my cabinet, where I often find items there that I do not use.  Most of what I review is very positive, yet some stand out over others.

I just don't love the way it feels going on. There's something... overly slick? ... about it. I still use it anyway on occasion. It's tinted, but it's not any kind of foundation; the tint just prevents that weird white undertone you sometimes get with zinc sunscreen. I use it under whatever makeup I'm using. I have to say it does seem to moisturize my skin, and it certainly keeps me from burning, which is the most important thing. As far as other anti-aging effects, I'm not sure whether this does anything in that regard. However, keeping the sun off your face is the most potent anti-aging action you can take, so I'm gonna say this stuff does at least most of what it claims to do.",1526860800,,"TIZO Photoceutical AM Replenish SPF 40 Sunscreen Primer, 1 fl. oz.",Luxury Beauty,$49.99,2018/05/21,-0.0031357620237914443
