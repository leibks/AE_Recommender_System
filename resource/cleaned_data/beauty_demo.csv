The scent is kind of a spicy herb smell.  Not overly mild, but very pleasant and not overpowering in my opinion.  I'd rank it as milder than the average Bath & Body Works lotion.  I'd love an even milder scent for my husband, but he doesn't hate it, and actually prefers it to the off-putting scent of things like unscented Lubriderm (which still has a strong odor).

I'd had a tube of this about 15 or so years ago that lasted me for years and years, and thankfully this seems to be about the same product.  The formula is super thick and concentrated, and does not need to be applied quite as liberally as many other standard lotions.  Additionally, the formula doesn't cause as severe of pain when applied to skin that is literally splitting open from dryness.  This is a must have for people whose hands or other parts of the body start to bleed during the winter without constant attention.  I wouldn't recommend it for daily full body application due to the price and thickness, but it's great for targeting problem areas.",1515283200,Crabtree &amp; Evelyn - Gardener's Ultra-Moisturising Hand Therapy Pump - 250g/8.8 OZ,Luxury Beauty,$30.00,2018/01/07,0.0016623439999999998

Not sure if this was a knock off (Im seeing others post comparison photos, and Ive never bought this brand before I did however go to Sallys and the bottle is different!) but this polish has destroyed my nails. They are peeling, brittle and just awful. Never have my nails received this amount of damage from any polish. Will never buy cosmetics through amazon again as there are too many fakes being sold, and too many fake reviews to back them up. Pretty sure this was right through amazon, not a third party seller.

Purchased dulce de leche for a wedding. I thought the color was pretty hideous, but the naipolish itself held up well. I took it to a salon and they gave me a manicure. If you're using base/top coats make sure you use Opi brand as others didn't work with it. Held up for the 3 days i needed it to, without any cracking or chipping. I doubt Ill ever use it again. Im just glad we didn't have open toe shoes. 10 nails exposing this color was enough. Lol. (It wasn't just me.

Now that I have a different job, the color will stay up to two and a half weeks!

Pros: no sheet marks!!, lasts
Cons: bubbles on nails (I don't shake the bottles, I roll them, so it isn't that), seems to lift nail polish off nails in places. This leaves marks on my nails where polish is visibly missing. This was a very odd thing I'd never noticed before with previous top coats or polishes. You can see what I mean by this in the pictures in the areas where my nails are clearly not entirely the color they're supposed to be.

After scooping out what you need and placing in your palm, use the spatula to stir it around. The heat of your hand will soften the makeup. Keep working it until it's as soft as you want it.  In the winter, I'll breathe into my palm if my hands are cold.  I always start with a makeup primer on my trouble ares.  The chin, laugh lines and upper lip and the little creases beside each nostril.  This is where the makeup likes to separate but if you use primer first it won't separate at all during the day.  I then use a cosmetic sponge wedge.  The disposable kind.  On areas I need more coverage, I pat the makeup on.  Then I let it set for a couple of minutes (air dry) and then I pat another layer on.  After my entire face is covered to my liking I walk around my house for about 5 minutes to allow the makeup to set up on it's own.  On hot days, I'll stand in front of a fan to help it along.  Then I take my big powder puff and lightly tap on powder all over my face.  Then I'll brush off the excess with a giant makeup brush.  Once that is done, I apply the rest of my makeup.  During the day I gently blot my chin and around my laugh lines and creases by each nostril with kleenex.  You don't need special blotting papers.  Kleenex and toilet paper work just as well.  Sometimes I put a little compact powder on my face but otherwise, this makeup doesn't budge and I never have to touch it up.  I've worked out with it on.  I've been caught in a down poor of rain with it on.  It never moved.  Yes it will rub off if you blow your nose.  Yes it will smudge onto your clothes if you are not careful. It's makeup, not a tattoo. It does, can and will come off if you don't pay attention to what you are doing.  But for those of us that need the coverage of this makeup, it works.",1524182400,"Dermablend Cover Creme Full Coverage Foundation with SPF 30, 1 Oz",Luxury Beauty,$39.00,2018/04/20,5.6200000000000004e-05

I bought about $150 worth of products that were too thin, the wrong color, or had no lasting power (you're only getting me to do this once a day).  I cam across DermaBlend and tried their Flawless Creator, which I really liked.  I thought that was that until I saw the Cover Cream.  It was advertised as makeup to cover tattoos, so I though, what the heck?  These raccoon eyes are *like* tattoos, right?  I'm never going back.  First, I was able to match my skin color almost perfectly (a think I have yet to do with the Flawless Creator).  Then, it worked like magic.  I do get slight creasing but that's probably b/c I am a makeup neophyte.  I almost never wore it, and I am only doing so now to hide the punching-bag-esq vibe my eyes give off naturally.

The product came very quickly and exactly as I purchase it from cosmetics stores,  in its original box. I will say that Dermablend is a VERY heavy make up and I use it AFTER my primer to keep it from settling into fine lines and I use it VERY sparingly. A little goes a really long way! I apply it mainly where I need the most coverage and blend a very small amount out across the rest of my face until it fades away. Once I have achieved the coverage that I need, I use a light weight BB cream all over my whole face and blend, blend, blend. People tell me that I have a flawless ""peaches and cream"" completion.

It comes with a spatula, but instead I moistened my fingertips and applied it as I would my normal foundation. I was quite surprised and impressed by the coverage as I blended it. Since it comes hardened in the jar it was not as easy to apply as a liquid is, but warming it with the fingers seemed to help the spread. I dotted it and blended on my brown spots and it didn't seem to cake but looked fairly natural. I was very pleased with the outcome.

So why only 4 stars -- well, the truth is that the hard product in the jar isn't that easy to use. I didn't use the ""scoop"" and just twirled my fingers in the jar. It would be easy to overdo this. It is essential to get the right color for your skin and there is a handy chart on the website to use. I was thinking that a sponge might help with application, but I find that those just waste a lot of product. I also use a powder to set it. It is definitely thicker than my usual make-up and it's important to apply thinkly to avoid the ""caked-on"" look.

Overall, I do like the foundation and I will keep using it. No hypersensitvity reaction nor increase in blemishes noted.",1520899200,"Dermablend Cover Creme Full Coverage Foundation with SPF 30, 1 Oz",Luxury Beauty,$39.00,2018/03/13,-0.005724521999999999

1416,5,,"03 10, 2018",A3J6R657T1HSQN,B0001Z66UM,Chris Lopez,"i thought at first I didn't need this spray. I mean why spend extra money when you can use your own hairspray?  But I found out that if you spray this on your scalp 1st and then puff or sprinkle the hair fibers on , the hair fibers stick better. You can if you want spray some additional spray on top. But I found this way is the best , because if you don't spray the spray first, the hair fibers don't stick to your scalp.  When I ran out of this spray, I tried my own unscented hairspray on my scalp first and it just didn't hold the fibers the way the toppik fiberhold spray did.  So I would definitely recommend this product. Also, for some reason, getting the puffer thing that you screw on top of the fiber bottle to dispense it lightly and evenly works great. So I guess what Im saying is that once you buy the Toppik hair fibers, buy the 1 time extra kit that has the fiberhold spray, the ballpump to help distribute the hair fibers. And it also comes with a little uneven comb like thing, which is not a comb. Its to make the powder look like its gone on naturally. But Ive never had to use it. Im just saying, its worth it to get that extra little kit""",1520640000,"Toppik Fiber Hold Spray, 4 oz",Luxury Beauty,$9.95,2018/03/10,-0.001273985

He's about as enthusiastic as you might imagine he'd be.  But luckily he's also easy going and game to give my plans a try.  In an effort to get him fully on board I looked at a lot of products and read hundreds of product reviews.  I knew if it felt greasy or smelled weird or was the least bit unpleasant, that the boyfriend would quietly stash it on a shelf and never use it.  The boyfriend has sensitive skin and sweats a lot at his job, so I needed something that wouldn't irritate his skin and wouldn't turn into an oily mess and run into his eyes after a long day.  This has fit the bill!  He actually likes it!  He says it feels nice when he puts it on.  So we are both happy: his face feels nice and I got him to wear sunscreen and hopefully he won't look like a piece of fruit leather when we retire.  Yay!

The lavender and Espresso line is wonderful. Soap and lotion both have a strong fragrance that lasts. The soap, like all triple milled soaps, has to be wrapped tightly in plastic after every use or the scent will dissipate to zero after several days.

This rosewater lotion is fantastic! It contains rosewater and parfum...parfum has oil in it and this is what makes the scent stronger and long-lasting.
This is thick lotion made for winter dry skin, not a thin moisturizer.
Is not sticky or tacky,
Absorbs fairly quickly
Leaves behind a very strong long lasting scent that smells just a rose garden.
Works very well on my super dry winter skin. I apply this whole body morning and night.",1517270400,"Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Body Lotion, Rosewater, 16.9 fl oz",Luxury Beauty,$28.00,2018/01/30,0.000488985

It's light enough that doesn't feel or stay greasy, but not extremely moisturizing either; so trade off there. Would do in the summer quite well, but winter requires something a little heavier than this for me. So I combine with a little jojoba for extra moisture and coverage to use less which accomplishes a couple of things: not only does the product last longer, but I can reduce the amount of chemicals I end up slathering on. I try to buy all natural usually, but the allure of something rose scented overrode the ""natural"" path this time.

I would recommend using a damp sponge to bake with. This product comes with a fluffy applicator that I use just to dab the powder all over my face. I then let it sit for a min or two and take a powder brush and blend into the skin until it's all gone. doing this is great and help sets the foundation/concealer and also is easier to apply bronzer, contour, and blush.
